1,"May I call to the Court's attention at the outset that we have handed out for the Court's convenience and have also distributed to counsel a compendium of those unpublished releases of the Commission under the Holding Company Act referred to in our brief, as well as a copy of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935",2,5,1
2,This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit,2,2,1
3,"It involves an extraordinary situation whereby the respondent, Louisiana Public Service Commission, through the device of appealing from a 1955 order of our Commission which merely denied a petition to reopen obtained in the court below more than two years after the time for review had expired, review of a 1953 S",2,2,1
4,E,0,0,1
5,C,0,0,1
6,order entered pursuant to Section 11 (b) of the Act,2,2,1
7,"The anomaly created by the court's decision below is even more obvious if the Court considers for a moment what would happen -- what would have happen if instead of having filed a petition to reopen in 1955, the respondent Louisiana Commission had filed a petition for review in an appropriate Court of Appeals",2,2,1
8,There can be no question,1,8,1
9,"but what if under Section 24 of the Act, that if the petition for review had been filed in 1955, the Court would have to dismiss that petition for one of jurisdiction",0,0,1
10,"Now, there are two orders that are involved in this case, although there is one order which was on review before the -- initially on review before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit",2,2,1
11,"The first of the orders which I referred to was our Commission's order of March 1953 which was entered pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act referred to and included in the appendix to our brief at page 49 which directed the intervening respondent, the Middle South Utilities, Inc",2,2,1
12,", and -- a registered holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the respondent, Louisiana Power & Light Company, to divest themselves of Louisiana powers non-electric assets pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1)",0,0,1
13,"I might call the Court's attention to the Commission's opinion which is found at page 103 of the transcript of record as well as the Commission's order which is found at page 127, and calling the Court's particular attention to page 128 in the latter part of the Commission's order of 1953, I would like the Court's indulgence just to read the language there, a part of the language of that order",0,0,1
14,"It is ordered pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act that Middle South and its subsidiaries, one of which is Louisiana Power, dispose their cause -- the disposition of their direct and indirect ownership in the non-electric properties owned by Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi in any appropriate manner not in contravention of the applicable provisions of the Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder",2,2,1
15,"And then in the latter --
-- portion --
Page 128 of the transcript of the record",2,3,1
16,"128, Your Honor",2,3,1
17,"And in the last paragraph, the Commission reserved jurisdiction to take further steps in the future as might be necessary and appropriate to give effects -- effect to that portion of its order",2,5,1
18,The second Commission order which is involved in this case is the order of the Commission of September 1955 which denied the Louisiana State Commission's petition to reopen the 1953 order to which I have just called the Court's attention,2,5,1
19,"Now, the order in 1953 was the result of a series, a long series of hearings and proceedings under Section 11 commencing back in 1942",2,2,1
20,"Suffice that to say for the purpose of this case that in 1949, among other things, the Commission acting pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) approved the creation of the Middle South Utilities, Inc",2,2,1
21,", as a holding company and reserved jurisdiction with respect to Middle South for the purpose of making determinations in the future as to the retainability by Middle South and its subsidiaries and in this case, Louisiana Power, of certain non-electric properties",2,2,1
22,"Now, acting under the reservation in its order of 1949, in January 1953, the Commission, pursuant again to Section 11 (b) (1) and other sections of the Act, issued a notice -- an order to Middle South and Louisiana Power and others",2,2,1
23,"In connection with that notice appearing, I should like to call to the Court' attention page 83 of the record and towards the top of the page, paragraph Number 3, the specific -- one of the specific issues enumerated in that notice of hearing whether Middle South and Louisiana should be required to take action to dispose of the gas utility assets and non-utility assets of Louisiana, and if so, what terms and conditions should be imposed in connection therewith?
And I think it's rather important also to notice in connection with this order that in the last paragraph thereof, the secretary acting upon orders of the Commission is very careful to provide for a registered notice and registered mail service upon each of the Public Service Commissions involved including the respondent, Louisiana Public Service Commission",0,0,1
24,"Now, in considering the facts of the case, one thing is absolutely certain and that is that the Louisiana Public Service Commission got notice of this hearing in 1953",2,5,1
25,There is no question or no dispute about that,1,10,1
26,"There is also no question about the fact that the hearing which was noticed, as I've just called to the Court's attention, for February 1953 was a full hearing, an evidentiary hearing",2,2,1
27,"The respondents, Louisiana Power and Middle South filed an answer which is found in full at page 84 of the record",2,2,1
28,Evidence was adduced with opportunity for cross-examination,2,5,1
29,That the Public Service Commission received notice and was entitled to come in as a person or a party if it so desired pursuant to the rules of practice of the Commission and it was specifically given notice so that it would have that opportunity if it desired,2,2,1
30,"In addition to the fact that there was a direct and cross-examination, an opportunity for the same, there were arguments presented in support of Middle South's position and of Louisiana Power's position which in short was that Louisiana Power's gas properties ought to be permitted to be retained by Middle South and Louisiana as an additional integrated public utility system within the proviso to Section 11 (b) (1), known as Clause (a) to which I will refer later on in the course of my argument",0,0,1
31,"But it's perfectly clear that Louisiana failed to appear, that is the Louisiana State Commission, when it had the opportunity",2,2,1
32,"It's also interesting to note that no one asked for an extension, they were so concerned about these legal determinations as to which they know call -- raise as substantial issues",2,5,1
33,"No one asked for an extension, neither Middle South nor Louisiana Power",2,2,1
34,"Now, in March, the Commission issued its findings and opinion and order and they are found in the record, the opinion is found from pages 104 to 126 and the order is found at page 127",2,3,1
35,"In short, the Commission ordered that Middle South and Louisiana Power divest themselves of all of the non-electric assets of Louisiana Power",2,2,1
36,"And when I say non-electric assets, I'm referring to the gas properties and to one water property",1,10,1
37,The reason that the Commission gave in its findings and opinion was that Middle South and Louisiana Power had failed to establish that separation of the gas assets held by Louisiana Power would result in the loss of substantial economies to that additional system,2,5,1
38,"And in talking about additional system, we are talking about the gas properties of Louisiana Power as required by Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) so as to justify the retention of those gas assets along with the electric assets of the Middle South system",2,5,1
39,"Now, very few things happened from that point on until 1954 and the only things that did happen looked toward compliance with the Commission's 1953 order which was entered after a full hearing",2,5,1
40,"Not only was there no petition for rehearing filed within five days as is provided by our rules of practice,",2,2,1
41,"but neither Middle South nor Louisiana Power sought to challenge the Commission's substantive determinations which are raised very definitely in the yellow brief, the brief of Louisiana Power & Light Company",2,2,1
42,No one challenged the substantive determinations within the 60-day period as is provided by statute under Section 24 (a) of the Act within which a petition for review might be filed,2,2,1
43,"As I have suggested, every action gave an appearance of compliance",1,10,1
44,"In fact as the record will demonstrate at pages 88 and 89, Middle South and Louisiana Power asked for additional time pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act within which to comply, to comply with the order of 1953",2,2,1
45,"And the Commission extended until March of 1955, the time within which the company's might come in and comply with the 1953 directive",2,2,1
46,"Now, on November 10th, 1954, they took another step",2,5,1
47,"Louisiana Power and Louisiana Gas Service Corporation, in short referred to as Louisiana Gas which is a newly organized and wholly owned subsidiary of Louisiana Power, filed an application-declaration with the Commission under the Act proposing among other things that the gas properties which the Middle South and Louisiana Power had been directed to dispose of be transferred along with the other non-electric properties to Louisiana Gas as a step looking forward -- looking toward compliance with the 1953 order",2,2,1
48,"Now, finally a year and nine months after the 1953 11 (b) order to which they had been working compliance with, Louisiana Commission sends a telegram, telegrams found in the record at page 89",2,5,1
49,And the substance of the telegram and the subsequent petition and supplemental petition filed and found at the record from pages 90 to 92 was the Commission opened up the record in year 1953 proceeding,2,5,1
50,We would like to come in and present some important additional evidence,1,10,1
51,"For example, I call the Court's attention to the brief on behalf of Louisiana Public Service Commission and particularly to the paragraph on page -- the two paragraphs on page 51, the -- the second and third paragraphs in which the Commission has asked to consider new evidence",2,5,1
52,"Now, the Commission asked for an offer of proof and at the request of the Louisiana Commission, extended the time for its filing",2,5,1
53,The offer of proof was received,2,2,1
54,"It is found in the transcript of record, commencing on page 1 and at page 5 thereof in the offer of proof, the Louisiana Commission sets forth the general reasons on which it bases its request for reopening",2,2,1
55,Briefs were submitted and oral argument was had,2,5,1
56,"And subsequently in September, the Commission came out with an opinion and order",2,3,1
57,The opinion is found commencing at the record at 129 and the order at the record 133 and denied the petition for reopening on the ground that there was no basis for reopening the proceedings in its opinion,2,5,1
58,"Now, in its opinion --
In the offer of proof, they offered to introduce evidence with respect to the operations of the companies in 1954, evidence as to the cost of those operations and the relative cost and perhaps losses which would occur if divestment were to be carried through and they had to comply",2,5,1
59,but those were based in 1954,0,0,1
60,"And as we point out in our reply brief just filed today, the -- the figures which they offer in connection with their offer of proof are in effect new data",2,5,1
61,They are based on new year's earnings,2,5,1
62,"In fact in 1952, the Commission was considering figures which were before it on the basis of the operations in 1952",2,2,1
63,"Here, they come in now two years later and they want to give new information or new data based on operations for the year-end in 1954",2,5,1
64,"Now, the Louisiana Commission filed its petition for review in the court below, requesting a review of the Commission's denial of its petition to reopen and also requesting a review of the Commission's order of March 1953, the divestment order",2,5,1
65,"We filed a motion to dismiss, the petition on the ground that in essence it was an attempt to appeal from an order as to which the time for appeal had long",2,5,1
66,since expired,2,5,1
67,"The court below found first that the Commission's order of 1955, denying the petition to reopen was reviewable and set it aside",2,5,1
68,It held that the S,0,0,1
69,E,0,0,1
70,C,0,0,1
71,", the Commission had in effect misinterpreted the -- in the 1953 proceeding Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) in legal determinations made in that proceeding in connection with the retainability by Louisiana Power of its non-electric properties and it remanded the matter to us for consideration in light of own its construction of Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1)",0,0,1
72,"Now, we think the court below was wrong, both on the procedural point and the substantive issue",1,10,1
73,"The one thing I would like to say, Mr",0,0,1
74,"Chief Justice, to you before proceeding to my argument is that I think upon examination of the offer of proof, the petition and the supplemental petition, the Court will readily see that there was no allegation in any of those documents of a change in conditions",1,10,1
75,And I think that as we will try to contend to demonstrate to the Court that is an important aspect of what has been referred to in this case as the procedural phase of it,2,2,1
76,We would still contend that it was not within the scope of -- proper scope of review of an order of an administrative agency such as ours,1,10,1
77,"That is the most serious and shocking aspect of the case as far as we are concerned, Mr",2,2,1
78,Justice Whittaker,2,3,1
79,"Now, we contend first of all, may it please the Court, that the court below committed error in permitting this 1955 attack upon a final and binding 1953 directive of our Commission",2,5,1
80,"In so doing, the Court relied on the last two sentences of Section 11 (b)",2,2,1
81,"And if the Court will indulge me once again, I should like to examine for the Court the last two sentences of 11 (b)",2,5,1
82,because we think the court below was wrong,2,5,1
83,"Those sentences are found on page 50 of our brief, the appendix there to our brief",2,2,1
84,"Now, it is interesting to know in going through the legislative history of this particular part of 11 (b) that nobody seems to know how these last two sentences got into the Public Utility Holding Company Act",2,5,1
85,There is no legislative history to guide us,1,8,1
86,We believe though that the reason for their inclusion becomes apparent on a sentence by sentence examination of those last two sentences of 11 (b),1,8,1
87,"Taking the last sentence first, it reads, ""Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Section 24",0,0,1
88,"""
Now, that merely repeats -- that merely repeats the provision for appeal as contained in Section 24",0,0,1
89,"And before I pass the legislative history, I would like to interrupt the train just a moment to point out as I neglected to do that the last two sentences were apparently added in the conference on the legislation and that may explain the reason why they're having been added at the last moment, there is no explanation in writing for them",2,5,1
90,But the last sentences I have indicated merely indicates that -- that Section 24 is applicable in an 11 (b) situation,2,2,1
91,"Now, presumably an order under 11 (b) would be reviewable in the absence of this last sentence, of the last paragraph of 11 (b)",2,5,1
92,I think this shows in effect that Congress was concerned,1,8,1
93,They were concerned lest one of these most important orders and I believe the Louisiana Power Company has referred to an order under this Section as the death sentence for which they seek commutation,1,10,1
94,It is that type of important order that is involved here and it is an order of unusual nature in the sense that it looks toward future compliance,2,5,1
95,The legislative history indicates that there was some discussion about the fact that the actual compliance with this order comes much later and the history of the proceedings under Section 11 (b) confirmed the wisdom of that legislative prophecy,2,5,1
96,"And I think also that the lawyers who were the draftsmen here were properly concerned perhaps that maybe in view of the fact that this type of 11 (b) order looked towards the future was in effect a directive to the systems to comply at some future date to come in with a plan which would comply with the standards of 11 (b), that there was a fear on the part of the lawyer-legislators that this might be attacked as an interlocutory order from which there was no appeal",2,5,1
97,And it was such an important order I think that Congress and we can at best speculate,1,8,1
98,but I think it is logical so to do that Congress felt that there ought to be a specific right of appeal from this type of order,0,0,1
99,"Now, looking at the first sentence, if I may refer now to that, the Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection if after notice an opportunity for hearing it finds that the conditions upon which the order was predicated do not exist",2,2,1
100,"Now, we believe that this language was inserted",2,5,1
101,because Congress was concerned that perhaps an order would be issued under 11 (b) based upon a set of particular conditions existing at a particular time which looked forward to compliance at a later date,2,5,1
102,"And that in the intervening period from the date of the 11 (b) order and the future time at which compliance might be affected, there could be a change of conditions and this being such an important order, there ought to be an opportunity for the parties to come in and to seek a modification or revocation thereof if the conditions had changed so that perhaps the order issued earlier was no longer appropriate for the new conditions",0,0,1
103,"Now, it seems to us that the insertion of this provision for this purpose makes awfully good sense",1,10,1
104,"We don't believe that Congress had in mind as the Court suggest below that this language, this first sentence was to be used to come in for reopening almost at any time after a final order under 11 (b) had been entered",2,2,1
105,We don't believe that the Congress have that in mind,1,10,1
106,"because we are also mindful that the first sentence of 11 (b) on page 49 of our brief says, ""It shall be the duty of the Commission as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938",2,3,1
107,"""
We think that the Congress had in mind that this Section ought to -- or that a compliance with this Section ought to be achieved as soon as possible",2,3,1
108,And such a determination or resolution it seems to us to be completely inconsistent with the concept that this first sentence opens the door for reopening such a long and protracted proceeding almost at any time at will as long as you make a allegation in effect that the record before the Commission was not complete,1,10,1
109,"And I think perhaps that it would be well to credit to the legislators, perhaps, this concern and that is that certainly without the specific statutory authorization given to the Commission, it's doubtful, extremely doubtful under existing precedence whether it would have had the power or would have the power to reconsider such an order particularly when that order had been before a court for review",2,5,1
110,"Thus, we think that these sentences have meanings which are contrary to the interpretations given to them by the court below",1,10,1
111,"As to the first sentence, the Commission has consistently interpreted to permit modification or revocation of 11 (b) orders only in the light of change in circumstances which had occurred",2,5,1
112,since the original order under 11 (b) was entered,2,5,1
113,And we have collected at page 18 of our brief that those line of cases were Commission decisions,2,5,1
114,"Now, as to the second sentence, the Commission contends that it means that 11 (b) orders are directly reviewable pursuant to Section 24 (a) of the Act which is found in the appendix to our brief, in which provides that a petition for review must be filed within 60 days",2,2,1
115,"Once 60 days has elapsed, it is the Commission's position -- if 60 days have gone by without the filing of a petition for review, we contend the order, the 11 (b) order is no longer subject to challenge by an attack upon the conditions found to have existed when the order was entered",1,10,1
116,"Now, we believe also that the court below erred in holding -- in holding that Section 11 (b) authorizes the reopening of a concluded proceeding without a showing of change in circumstance",2,5,1
117,"Now, let's see what the Court did to reach this interpretation",1,8,1
118,"The Court construed the first sentence, which we have just reviewed, to permit a modification where it can be shown that the conditions on which the order was predicated were not truly the actual condition or in other words in the Court's own language found at the record 138 that modification might be based on the facts as they existed of the time of the order which is to be modified",2,2,1
119,"Now, this is -- interpretation in our opinion is nothing",1,10,1
120,but an open invitation to anyone in an 11 (b) proceeding who thinks he might have made a better case at some later date to come along and file a petition for rehearing,2,5,1
121,And we think that if this Court agrees with us in our construction that it ought -- just plain reverse and go no further with any of the issues in the case,2,5,1
122,"To put it in another way, if this decision below is allowed to stand, all someone has to do who has rights in such a proceeding is to make a mere allegation that data in the original record before our Commission is incomplete and this decision will open the door",1,10,1
123,This type of reopening is rare indeed in the life of an administrative agency,2,2,1
124,It is even rarer when the court below requires the administrative agency to reconsider its decision made in another -- in an earlier proceeding as to which it has issued a final order back in 1953,2,5,1
125,We say that this result reached by the court below could only be reached if the statutory language is so clear that it precludes any other interpretation,2,2,1
126,"And frankly, it is our position that the language of the first sentence doesn't compel any such construction as placed upon it by the court below",1,10,1
127,It is contrary to the congressional intent,1,10,1
128,"We believe that in putting in this sentence, the Congress was mindful of its own admission -- admonition in 11 (b) to obtain compliance as soon as practicable",1,10,1
129,Exactly,1,12,1
130,Exactly,1,12,1
131,Exactly,1,12,1
132,"If this Court agrees with the Commission's interpretation --
Yes, Mr",0,0,1
133,Justice,1,12,1
134,"Well, we take the position that the petition for reopening under these circumstances is wholly discretionary with the Commission and that there might be a situation where -- in an extreme situation where you could perhaps show an abuse of such discretion",1,10,1
135,but certainly that's not in this case,0,0,1
136,"Well, perhaps if there was a showing of fraud on the agency and the agency just refused to pay any attention to it, I would consider that a real abuse of discretion",1,10,1
137,"But there is certainly none of that here as the --
Well, may I say this, Mr",0,0,1
138,"Justice Brennan, that it seems to me from reviewing the cases they have pretty consistently held that as far as the petition for rehearing is concerned before an administrative agency, it is a matter wholly within the discretion of the agency",2,5,1
139,I understand that there was a case many years ago involving the I,1,8,1
140,C,0,0,1
141,C,0,0,1
142,"which held to the contrary, the Atchison case",0,0,1
143,"But subsequently, in I",0,0,1
144,C,0,0,1
145,C,0,0,1
146,"versus Jersey City, this Court very clearly restricted the decision in that case to the facts of that case",2,2,1
147,"And in direct answer to your question, I would say we contend that a petition for rehearing is wholly in the discretion of the administrative agency, although I would not eliminate the possibility of an extreme situation where the agency acted manifestly with arbitrariness in complete disregard of some patent fact that it ought to construe",0,0,1
148,"As I was about to say if this Court agrees with the Commission's interpretation of the first sentence, we submit that that's as far as this Honorable Court need to go and it should promptly reverse the decision below",1,10,1
149,"Now, the interpretation by the court below of the second sentence is in our opinion clearly inconsistent with the review provisions of Section 24 (a) and the prevailing precedence",1,10,1
150,"Again, may I call your attention to the second sentence, ""Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Section 24",0,0,1
151,"""
Now, what did the Court hold below with respect to this sentence?
It held first of all that it could review an S",0,0,1
152,E,0,0,1
153,C,0,0,1
154,order denying a petition to reopen,2,2,1
155,"In the second instance, it held that it could require this Commission to consider matters which could have been",1,10,1
156,but which were not presented in the full hearing in 1953,0,0,1
157,"And thirdly, it held that it could review at the same time legal determinations made by our Commission in connection with the 1953 proceeding",2,5,1
158,"Now, this interpretation runs completely counter to the prevailing general rule that in the interest of the end of litigation, a failure to file a timely petition for review jurisdictionally precludes appellate review",1,10,1
159,"As I have suggested earlier, the acceptance of this decision below in our view creates a real absurdity, to wit by filing a petition for rehearing, the Louisiana Commission can now obtain a full review in the Court of Appeals of the order denying the petition for reopening as well as the 1953 order, whereas if the same Commission had filed a petition for review on the same date in an appropriate Court of Appeals, it would have to be dismissed",1,10,1
160,"Now, even assuming for the sake of argument that the denial of an application for modification is appealable, we believe the Court's interpretation of the last sentence was an error, both as to the availability of judicial review and the scope of judicial review",1,10,1
161,"Admittedly, orders under Section 11 (b) which actually revoke or modify previous orders are reviewable",1,10,1
162,That we concede,1,10,1
163,"But the last sentence of 11 (b) is interpreted by the court below as making the denial of a request to reopen expressly reviewable, while the words ""any order under this subsection"" as are used therein are there",2,2,1
164,We submit the only orders mentioned in this Section are these,2,2,1
165,"First, orders directing that certain action be taken either integration or simplification",1,9,1
166,"And second, that orders revoking or modifying such original orders",0,0,1
167,There's absolutely no mentioned in this Section of orders denying a petition for reopening,2,2,1
168,"Certainly, action taken by the Commission which takes the form of an order and which is not required by the Act to be affected by order is not normally reviewable",1,10,1
169,"For example, it has been held in a Court of Appeals decision, Eastern Utilities Associates versus S",2,2,1
170,E,0,0,1
171,C,0,0,1
172,in 162 F,0,0,1
173,"2d, that an order of the Commission setting 11 (b) proceeding down for a hearing is not reviewable",0,0,1
174,"Now, even assuming once again that under certain circumstances there may be a review of an order denying revocation or modification after hearing",2,5,1
175,We contend that such a review would nevertheless be unavailable under this second sentence from the denial of a petition to reopen without hearing to the extent that the petition is based on facts which existed at the time of the original order,1,10,1
176,"Thus, even if the first sentence were construed to authorize the Commission, the S",0,0,1
177,E,0,0,1
178,C,0,0,1
179,"to revoke or modify a prior order upon a finding as the court below suggest that conditions upon which it was predicated did not truly exist at the time of the entry of the original 11 (b) order, it does not follow that such denial would be reviewed",2,5,1
180,It's no different in our view from any other petition for rehearing,1,8,1
181,"There seems to be no reason in our opinion why the denial of such petition in essence only a petition for rehearing should be anymore subject to review than the denial of any other petition for rehearing, the normal basis for which that some falls in the record",1,10,1
182,It is fairly well set of law the denial of the petition for rehearing is wholly discretionary,1,10,1
183,"Certainly, it is clear in the law that a party, after the time for appeal has expired, may not reinvest himself with the right of appeal by filing a petition for rehearing",2,5,1
184,"I call to the Court's attention, Conboy versus First National Bank of Jersey City in 203 U",2,3,1
185,S,0,0,1
186,"Well, if it's a proceeding or a new trial on newly discovered evidence, assume you would get into the question of the term of the Court and whatnot which may not be issue -- an issue in the federal court",2,5,1
187,"But in our view under this Act, just new evidence alone is not sufficient to be a basis for the reviewability of such -- what we consider to be a wholly discretionary order",1,10,1
188,"Well, we have a procedure which would enable the respondents here to come in for a rehearing within five days --
-- under our rules of practice",2,5,1
189,but not one that analogous to what Mr,0,0,1
190,Justice Harlan has suggested,1,10,1
191,"We take the position that there was --
Exactly that there was no allegation here or indication of a change in the circumstances or facts and we take that position on the basis of what the Louisiana Commission filed with our Commission and what -- what is included from the transcript of record",2,5,1
192,"Well, that's -- that's correct and if that is so --
We take the position on the contrary, if Your Honor pleases, that it's the plain sense of -- of this provision read in light of the entire Act and the purpose of 11 (b) that this language was put in there to enable someone who was faced with such a change of conditions that made the original 11 (b) order almost non-compliable, where he could come in and seek a modification or revocation",0,0,1
193,"But just to -- to come in and challenge the truth to the facts as they existed before, we don't believe that this goes that far",2,5,1
194,We don't have to reach that question here,1,10,1
195,"If they had tried it out under the language of the statute, which provides for a notice, an opportunity for hearing on the question of modification or revocation and they had a full evidentiary hearing, which was not held here on that question, then I think we have a different case",1,10,1
196,"They're -- they are -- they --
Back in 1953?
As I have indicated to the Court, we consider this no different from any other petition for rehearing",1,10,1
197,"And as we believe it, well established in the law, there seems to be no reason why this is not a matter completely within the discretion of the Commission",2,2,1
198,"Now, at page 138 of the record in its decision, the court below said, ""Its review was not circumscribed by the rules applying to review of discretionary acts",2,5,1
199,"""
Now, we contend that that is error",1,8,1
200,We contend that the last sentence of 11 (b) provides only that the Commission may revoke or modify its previous order whereas other provisions of Section 11 (b) used mandatory language,2,2,1
201,"For example, on page 50, right above the last two sentences, the Court will note that the statute employs the use of the word ""shall""",2,2,1
202,"It is our contention that this discretionary nature of the pertinent phrases dictates the judicial review if any should be eliminated to considerations of abuses of discretions and certainly none can be shown here, all one has to do is to examine the Commission's opinion and to examine the offer of proof which did not allege or indicate that the original factual in conclusions were incorrect",1,10,1
203,The abuse of discretion is not shown here and we feel that the Court went far beyond the permissible scope of review,1,10,1
204,"Now, in the few moments that I have left here, I would like to call the Court's attention in fact that there are substantive issues",2,5,1
205,"It's our position that you don't -- that Your Honors do not have to reach those questions here, that there is -- in the procedural aspects of this case a sufficient basis for prompt reversal of the decision of the court below",1,10,1
206,But I would like to mention in a very brief outline just what the substantive issues are and it maybe that I will not get to our position on them and perhaps until my rebuttal time and I hope the Court will indulge me if that would be the case,0,0,1
207,Calling the substantive issues which have been decided by the Commission in its 1953 proceeding and reviewed by the court below involved interpretations of what is referred to as Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) found on page 49 of our brief,2,2,1
208,"And if the Court would read from the italicized language beginning, ""Provided",2,2,1
209,"however that the Commission shall permit a registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional integrated public utility systems, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that A,"" and this is Clause (a), ""Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss for substantial economies,"" and those are crucial words, ""which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system",0,0,1
210,"""
Now, we take the position that the Court was in error in interpreting this particular clause",1,10,1
211,Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act requires that the operations of each registered holding company system be limited to a single integrated public utility system and to certain incidental businesses,1,10,1
212,"Now, this proviso to 11 (b) (1), Clause (a), which I have just read, permits retention of one or more additional systems as an exception to the integration requirements if it can be shown that such retention meets the exacting requirements set forth not only in Clause (a)",0,0,1
213,but in Clause (b) and (c),0,0,1
214,"Now, these substantive issues revolve around the words loss of substantial economy",1,10,1
215,"Now, first in construing Clause (a), the question is, should those words apply to the principal system, Middle South electric properties or only to the additional system, Louisiana gases properties -- gas property?
And second, the question is, what is meant by the words loss of substantial economy?
Those two questions are at issue if the Court has to reach these substantive matters",0,0,1
216,"Now, we contend that the words loss of substantial economies refers only to the potential loss which would be incurred by the additional system, the gas properties, if it were free from the single integrated electric utility system",1,10,1
217,"And second, we contend that loss of substantial economy means that the free utility system, the gas properties, could not stand on its own feet and operate economically if it were independent",1,10,1
218,"To wit, we contend that Congress and we contend also and can demonstrate we believe that the legislative history supports us in this position that Congress expected, if there were to be such an additional system, that it would be able to stand on its own feet and capable of managing its own affairs",2,2,1
219,"Unlike the last two sentences of Section -- of 11 (b) which we have discussed at length here, the legislative history here makes it clear that the draftsman intended the phrase to be interpreted as it has been interpreted consistently by the Commission",2,2,1
220,And may I again ask the Court's indulgence and suggest reference to our brief at page 40,2,5,1
221,But I think that at that point I will reserve my further remarks on the substantive issues until my rebuttal time,1,10,1
222,"Your Honor and Justices of the Court, may it please the Court",2,5,2
223,"I think that possibly one of the clearest answers that can be given to the petition in this case was indicated by the procedure here this morning when in connection with admissions to the Bar of this Court, each applicant was required to produce somebody who would certify that the applicant satisfied the requirements of the Bar of this Court",1,10,2
224,New York has a similar requirement with respect to its Bar,1,10,2
225,The process of admission as Mr,2,2,2
226,"Willner has stated has been entrusted by the New York courts to the various Appellate Divisions, the four Appellate Divisions throughout the state",2,2,2
227,Each of these Appellate Divisions dealing with residence in its own district has what has been described as a Character Committee,2,2,2
228,"This Character Committee can affect forms for the large group of applicants to the Bar in New York, the same function that was performed here this morning by previously admitted members of a Bar of this Court",2,2,2
229,It examines into the character of each applicant and if the Committee is satisfied as to the applicant's character and fitness it certifies to the Appellate Division that the applicant is entitled to admission,2,2,2
230,"Now --
It's not exactly like yours, it's not --
Exactly Your Honor, in effect there is a monopoly,",0,0,2
231,"but it is a monopoly which exists under the law of the State of New York, they – there isn't any challenge as I see it to the procedural provision that requires the endorsement by the Committee that is not the question that is been presented either by Mr",2,2,2
232,"Waldman, for his client or by the Bill of Rights Committee of the Bar Association, which has filed a brief amicus",2,3,2
233,"No, that's not agreed to at all",1,10,2
234,"The – and as a matter of fact if an admission were denied arbitrarily in New York, there is a procedure under – we submit under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act which would provide for review of any arbitrary action by the Committee",2,2,2
235,"Your Honor is absolutely right, if this is in effect an investigating committee of the Court",1,10,2
236,"[Inaudible] was applied at the Court for admission, he can attempt review as I suggested by Article 78",2,2,2
237,The situation here with Mr,1,9,2
238,Waldman -- with Mr,2,3,2
239,Willner,1,8,2
240,"but the – apparently at no time after his various denials to be applied directly to the Appellate Division for review of an action by the Committee, the –
I think that is a fact and I think that the record will bear that out",0,0,2
241,"There were various applications that were made, various boards of applications,",2,2,2
242,"but if I can get down to the facts briefly, possibly I can show you exactly what happened",0,0,2
243,The first application that was made by Mr,2,2,2
244,"Willner --
Well to those questions one at a time",2,5,2
245,"In response to your first question, there are no absolute requirements that I can find in the New York Statute for any hearing",1,10,2
246,"There are no absolute requirements for cross examination or confrontation, that --
Pardon?
No, the statute does not prescribe in any sort of detail, the procedure that is to be followed by this Committee",2,5,2
247,The Committee is primarily an investigating committee and is so designated in the statutes which provides for its creation,2,2,2
248,The committee is -- has its procedure prescribed only in or approximately a very limited degree by stating that one of the procedures that it can require from an applicant is that he submit two affidavits in support of his application by attorney showing his good moral character,2,2,2
249,"Apart from that the Committee is pretty much left on its own as an investigator for the court, as an arm of the court, to go out and to obtain its information in the manner in which it deems it best to obtain the information",2,5,2
250,There are no limitations on its processes of investigation,1,10,2
251,The committee advertises as soon as an applicant files his application with the committee and transmits the certificate that he has satisfied the scholarship requirements by passing the Bar Exam,2,2,2
252,Committee advertises in the Law Journal the names of the persons who have applied for admission,2,2,2
253,"Attorneys, other persons who see the advertisement in the Law Journal respond, send in whatever information they have",2,3,2
254,The committee itself has investigators,2,2,2
255,"The staff is a relatively small staff, who are able to go out and to check up on the information that they receive,",2,5,2
256,"but the ultimate function of the committee is not to pass upon the application for admissions to the Bar, not to adjudicate that a person is not entitled to admission,",0,0,2
257,"but simply to transmit to the Appellate Division when it receives this information, which is unfavorable",0,0,2
258,"Now when there is no such information, when there is nothing which comes before the committee, which acts as sort of a danger signal, a warning to the committee that it should stop",2,5,2
259,The committee is in a position where it can certify that an applicant is entitled to admission to the Bar,2,2,2
260,"When information comes --
Yes, page four of --
No, that certificate is sent to the Appellate Division and the Appellate Division acts on it pretty much pro forma",2,2,2
261,"In most cases they will admit a very large class at one time, sometimes it comes to 300 or 400",2,2,2
262,Now this is the pathological case,1,10,2
263,They get in touch with the applicant,2,2,2
264,"They bring him in for – before a sub-committee, generally consisting of three to five members",2,2,2
265,In this particular department they work with two sub-committees both consisting of five members generally,2,2,2
266,This was the procedure back in 1937 and 1938,2,2,2
267,Originally,0,0,2
268,however in this particular case they brought him in before a three-man sub-committee as was stated and Mr,2,2,2
269,"Wieder was confronted with these letters, or this -- the record indicates one letter at that particular time, which had been received filing a compliant against him",2,5,2
270,Presumably he was informed as to the substance of the complaint,2,5,2
271,"The sub-committee apparently thought there was enough here to worry about to have a full hearing and a hearing was arranged, Mr",2,5,2
272,"Wieder, however, was not informed beyond apparently the substance of this letter as to the nature of the compliant that had been filed against him",2,5,2
273,Mr,0,0,2
274,Willner,1,8,2
275,"They are so much alike --
Wieder is the complainant",2,5,2
276,Mr,0,0,2
277,"Willner, the applicant was the only person present",2,5,2
278,"Willner is the applicant for admission, and no one was present at the hearing",2,3,2
279,"These hearings are held privately, secretly, confidentially, so that the facts as to an applicant are not exposed to the public at large",2,2,2
280,Applicants as to whom unfavorable information is received are protected against publicity on such complaints and there is -- and possibly they may not turn not to be true,2,5,2
281,"Willner attended the hearing and as Justice Harlan has pointed out in the Second Koenigsberg case, the hearings are a form of obtaining information from these applicants",2,2,2
282,One of the best methods of obtaining information from applicants is by examining them on the basis of information that has been obtained as to them,1,10,2
283,No,1,12,2
284,The complainants were never brought in for hearing,2,5,2
285,"This was not an adversary type of proceeding, apparently what happened was that the committee, the Character Committee sent out its own investigator to check to a certain extent or as far as this investigator could, on the details of the complaints that were filed against the applicant and on the basis of the report that was brought back by the committee's own investigator, the applicant was examined before the committee",2,2,2
286,"Now, he was given notice through the form of questioning as to the nature of the charges and complaints that were filed against him",2,5,2
287,"He was given an opportunity to deny or admit the charges, in connection with the first complaint, and the first complaint was that this applicant had attempted to serve a clerkship where the attorney Weider had not completed it for various reasons",2,2,2
288,The applicant admitted that he had failed in his questionnaire before the committee that set forth the fact that he had been employed by Weider,2,3,2
289,"Now, the fact of employment was significant",2,5,2
290,because it indicated a non-disclosure of a fact that apparently the committee deemed material,2,2,2
291,"In view of the fact, this man actually did not require a clerkship",2,5,2
292,"The committee apparently did not dispose completely of the application in a negative form,",2,5,2
293,"but as you will see, as you go through the history of this case, it gave Mr",0,0,2
294,Willner an opportunity to come in supply whatever information he had to disprove the charges in the complaint,2,5,2
295,"These were not formal charges, this was just material contained in the letter",2,2,2
296,The substance of my argument it seems has to be reduced in view of the short time that I have and I'm not going to try to quote with this whole record,1,10,2
297,"But the record will indicate that at various times the Committee deferred its disposition of this matter, granted various adjournments in effect to the applicant, to give him an opportunity to clear up his record",2,5,2
298,"Each time that he was given such an opportunity, there was a new complaint, there was something else that appeared that was disadvantageous to Willner",2,5,2
299,Each time that the committee set this matter down for hearing that was material before it that could be considered as reflecting upon his character,2,5,2
300,"Now, there was no formal disposition in his first application until 1938",2,2,2
301,"I would say that the --
It's a very general finding, Your Honor, which indicates that the Committee was not satisfied as to that this particular applicant was fit for admission to the Bar and that he had the moral character which entitled him to admission",0,0,2
302,"It is not a --
He can apply to the Appellate Division –-
-- at that time he can apply for review",2,2,2
303,He can move his admission,1,8,2
304,"It seems to me, might have some sort of procedure available by which he could ask for a hearing",2,2,2
305,"There is nothing, which prohibits it",2,2,2
306,"There is no statute on it, there are no rules and regulations which have been prescribed",2,2,2
307,There is just the general procedure that is available either by way of motion practice in New York or by way of our so called Article 78 review the determination of an administrative body,2,2,2
308,"Now in effect, what Mr",0,0,2
309,"Waldman suggests that we throw away the whole book, on the record it was of what has occurred with relation to the applicant, what they have, what I have set forth as to the proceedings before the Character Committee",2,3,2
310,"The various hearings that were held in 1938, 1948 and disregard this record in effect what he is asking us to do is to say that any of the facts before the Committee were immaterial",2,5,2
311,"because his client was not given the right to cross-examine and to confront the people who filed the first two complaints against him, Weider and Dempsey",2,3,2
312,"Now --
Well, our experience in connection with these cases is very limited",2,5,2
313,Generally what happens is that these committees treat these matters as non-adversary proceedings,2,2,2
314,They have no ax to grind,1,10,2
315,Their report goes to the court as an arm of the Court,2,2,2
316,"It is then up to the court to determine what it should do,",1,10,2
317,"but the court is in a position where on its own motion, it can direct such a hearing, it can direct that the hearing be held, whenever it wants to in -- if a situation develops that requires a trial-type hearing",2,5,2
318,Most of these cases apparently are disposed by the Character Committee in a manner where they will not receive ex parte any information which the applicant is not given an opportunity to explain or to deny and the position of the committee is that it proceeds only on information which is not ex parte,2,2,2
319,"Now, if in connection with any particular application before, the committee has unfavorable information, information that makes it set up its own, and so here, this man must wait, the committee, it seems to me is not acting arbitrarily if it has in its possession unfavorable information",2,5,2
320,"In this particular case, the assumption is that everything was set against Willner in these first two complaints was credited",1,10,2
321,If the complaints were completely credited and as to the first one of the charges was that the man asked for a false affidavit that he had served the clerkship,2,5,2
322,"I'm sure that if, if the committee had accepted that that it would never have allowed Willner later on and the Court itself would not have allowed Willner at a later day to have filed a new application for admission as it did in 1948",2,2,2
323,"If it had accepted the second charge, which would in effect was that Willner had engaged in a fraudulent transaction where he promised that he could put through an RFC loan that he had to pay moneys to an RFC employee to bring about the loan, if these charges had been taken in hold -- at face value by the distinguished members of the Bar who constitute this Committee then it seems to me that again the 1948 application would not have been allowed",2,5,2
324,"These would have been allegations of a sort that would have so, despite the man's character if accepted that he should not have been allowed to file a second application",2,5,2
325,"Well he can pick --
Well, it seems to me that the answer to that is substantially the answer I tried to give you a little while ago and that is that the application, the man can bring his case to court and say this is what happened, this is how I was examined before the Committee, I do not know on what ground my application was denied for a certificate, not my application for admission, the application for admission must be made to the court, I don't know why this Committee is not giving me a certificate",2,2,2
326,"I ask you the Appellant Division of the State of New York to direct the Committee to come in with a report which is specific, which contains findings which will inform me of the basis upon which my application has been denied",2,3,2
327,"Now he did not do that at the time --
He can get such a hearing by applying directly to the Appellate Division which in its inherent power has the right to grant such a hearing",2,2,2
328,"There is --
He didn't do that when he -- what apparently what happened is that after an application is denied the applicant is notified by letter, by the Secretary of Character Committee that his application for a certificate of good character has been denied",2,5,2
329,"He went back to the Appellate Division,",0,0,2
330,but at the times that he went back these manners will rather stale,1,10,2
331,"When you mentioned the first time, the first time apparently he went to the Appellate Division was 1943, which was five years after his application for a certificate had first been denied, he started this --
Well, in 1943 apparently what happened was that the Appellate Division denied without opinion his --
His request on the basis of the report that has been transmitted to it by the Character Committee",2,2,2
332,"At that time he had asked for a hearing relative to his admission to the Bar in which he stated that he deemed it inadvisable to set forth at great detail, the various phases of testimony and the basis upon which his application for admission to the Bar was denied",2,2,2
333,Now that very allegation would seem to indicate that at that time he knew I had a pretty good idea of the basis upon which his application had been denied back in 1938,2,5,2
334,"His hearing before the committee had been quite extended --
He wanted to be appraised --
Well this was not in 19 -- he didn't say if there was a conspiracy in 1943",2,2,2
335,He said in his original application for leave and we're here simply on an application for a leave to renew his application upon his application for leave to renew in 1961 that there was conspiracy,2,5,2
336,"Back in 1943 and this record is rather complex and I'd had to dig it out individual file papers, he said that he knew two things, first a considerable stress had been placed at his hearing, this first hearing on the fact that he had set forth in answer to a request for information that he had served no clerkship",2,5,2
337,"He didn't hit directly on the point the fact that he had --
In effect that was what he asked for",2,2,2
338,He asked that he -- he didn't get that at that time,2,3,2
339,"There isn't any explanation that I can find in the record the Appellate Division disposed of thing without opinion, I can only speculate that on the basis of the report that had been made by the committee and you'll find a reference to that at page 33 of my brief, 33 to 34, the Committee had reviewed the testimony and the hearings at which Willner had been personally present and in addition to they set forth certain details as to his conduct between 1938 date and 1943 application",2,5,2
340,"Why the Appellate Division --
Well --
Let me say this, I would say that all of this material is rather academic as back to 1943,",0,0,2
341,because the Appellate Division actually allowed him in 1948 to renew his application,2,2,2
342,I would say that every -- well let me tell you what happened in 1948,2,5,2
343,"Before the Appellate division?
Well he -- apparently various representatives of his have seen the material in the file at various times",2,5,2
344,"It's not clear whether they saw the confidential reports by the Character Committee to the Appellate Division that little gap, which may not be considered by the court is a little gap is missing",2,2,2
345,"Well, I would say that he's had an opportunity to defend himself against it,",2,5,2
346,because the record shows at first he was granted this opportunity in 1948 to file a new application for admission,2,5,2
347,"In 1948 it appeared that he had testified falsely in a civil proceeding as to one, whether he was a member of a certified Public Accountants Associate",2,3,2
348,"This material which was incorporated in the various reports by members of the Character Committee to the --
He had made an application before the Appellate --
I don't whether these motions were argued orally or whether they were submitted simply on the basis of the motion papers,",0,0,2
349,but there were various motions returnable before the Appellate Division,2,2,2
350,He never requested before the Appellate Division that he be granted,2,2,2
351,That's right,1,10,2
352,"He asked that at this -- in connection with a particular application, which is before this Court for review, where in effect --
Yes, Your Honor",0,0,2
353,"Well I think --
I think the answer to that has to depend upon the nature of function that this particular Committee performs",1,10,2
354,I would say that it does not deny him due process,1,10,2
355,"If he failed to request at an appropriate time, a hearing before the Court itself",2,5,2
356,"One, it's a little bit tardy",1,10,2
357,"Witnesses --
Just about",0,0,2
358,I think it is,1,9,2
359,because witnesses die,2,2,2
360,"Well, I think he is pretty much in the same situation as somebody who tries to get certiorari from this Court and tries at about six weeks or 20 days too late",1,10,2
361,"I think that the time for him to make his application was at the time when there are people available who can testify, pro or con",1,10,2
362,"Well, I didn't say at anytime",0,0,2
363,"I'd say within -- under your New York Statute, the provision that deals with the ordinarily review of the determination of an administrative body requires that an application for a view be taken promptly",0,0,2
364,An investigative body,2,2,2
365,It's an investigative body primarily; the only administrative function that I can see that it performs is to issue or not to issue a certificate,2,2,2
366,"Now, if you -- pardon?
I don't think that -- I don't think that the question has ever been formally presented to the New York courts for review",0,0,2
367,"In this particular case?
In 1939?
In 1961, it --
In May 1961 you had an application, which was an application addressed to the Discretion of the Court for leave to renew an application for admission to the Bar",2,2,2
368,They just denied it,1,10,2
369,The reason that they denied it is not clear,2,2,2
370,They did that,2,2,2
371,because this Committee and the Court itself has assumed that it is its functions,2,5,2
372,"Possibly, I have clouded the issue rather than straighten it out",1,10,2
373,"But let me say this, this particular Committee has acted, as Justice Harlan indicated a little while ago as an arm of the Court",2,2,2
374,The Court has assumed through the years and it was not until 1960,2,2,2
375,"Now, that in any case, the Court of Appeals called upon the Attorney General to submit a brief or to argue in the Court of Appeals, any appeal connected with the disposition of an application for admission to the Bar",2,2,2
376,The matter has always been considered as an intra-court process,1,10,2
377,The Character Committee reported to the Appellate Division,2,2,2
378,The Appellate Division in case there was any application disposed the application,2,2,2
379,"If an appeal were taken to the Court of Appeals, the papers were transmitted just as they were in this case to the Court of Appeals",2,2,2
380,"Now, it was not until the disposition of matter of anonymous, which I've referred to in my brief in 1960, that for the first time, so far as I know, the Court of Appeals called upon any outside agency being the Attorney General's office in that particular case, and the Attorney -- this is the second time that it has called on the Attorney General to intervene in a case, and to act as an advocate",2,2,2
381,"The theory of a Court being that this is a matter, which requires the Court's own exercise of discretion, apparently being -- that the theory being that these experienced members of the Bar will not out of hand arbitrarily or otherwise on the basis of ex parte evidence dispose off any applicant arbitrarily",2,5,2
382,It's exactly what they say we have done here,2,2,2
383,They say we've acted arbitrarily,2,5,2
384,because we haven't given this man a hearing,2,5,2
385,"That in every case we got to give a man no --
Well, in the Court of Appeals, in the very case, which they cite, this matter of anonymous that came through the Court of Appeals last year",2,2,2
386,"The Court of Appeals indicated that if a proper application were made to the Court of Appeals for the papers, they would be allowed to be examined by the applicant",2,2,2
387,The Court of Appeals in that case afforded that opportunity and directed that the confidential file be supplied,2,3,2
388,"Now, one of the difficulties with the position here is no such application was ever made",1,10,2
389,"Now, the failure to take advantage of the available remedy, it seems to me indicates a failure of advocacy possibly, a lack of diligence by Willner,",1,10,2
390,"but --
That decision was handed down in 1960",0,0,2
391,"When you say --
This is not this case I'm about, Your Honor",0,0,2
392,"I'm afraid that Your Honor is going to have to read this record a little bit more carefully, than I've been able to explain it within the limits of a 30-minute argument",1,10,2
393,"The record -- this book which the Appellant asks us to disregard completely contains facts which indicate that in 1943, possibly the basis upon which a hearing could have been granted, might have been outlined by the Appellant,",2,2,2
394,but there would not have been at that time an arbit -- yeah,0,0,2
395,There is no reason why that could not be done in New York without an express rule,1,10,2
396,"Actually what happened in this particular case was that apparently the Court concluded that on the basis of the facts and --
You have the facts on the basis, your own Committee's report and that --
Ordinarily, I should say --
Well, I think that possibly the questions that have been asked within the past few minutes indicate an unwillingness to accept what has been the traditional method of dealing with applications for admission to the Bar",0,0,2
397,"I think it's --
It's accurate and up-to-date statement of the – of the Committee's procedures",2,5,2
398,"Let me say this, the Bill of Rights Committee filed its brief amicus rather late, gave me very little chance to reply",2,5,2
399,I've done as well as I could within relatively few days in getting out a reply to the Bill of Rights Committee,2,5,2
400,"Now it seems to me that one of the things that we are heading for in this discussion of the case is a question as to whether the Bill of Rights Committee is correct in suggesting, that as to this particular type of investigation in to the conduct of a particular individual, the rules which ordinarily apply to trial type hearings should apply",1,10,2
401,"Now, our --
That judicial process can be available if on the facts that's presented -- a showing has made to the Court with such a judicial proceeding as warranted",2,5,2
402,"I don't see anything in the New York law that prohibits that, even though Jersey needs to have a specific provision",1,10,2
403,"Yeah, that's right",1,12,2
404,That's right,1,10,2
405,That's right,1,10,2
406,That's right,1,10,2
407,That's right,1,10,2
408,The record is on file in the clerk's office,2,3,2
409,It's been stipulated between the parties that these papers which were the original papers can be examined by the Court,2,2,2
410,I have summarized in this completely as I can,1,8,2
411,Pardon,1,9,2
412,"Oh!
I would say that this no higher than these two stacks of papers",0,0,2
413,"They --
There is no represent -- I gather, they were allowed to file a brief,",2,2,2
414,but not to argue,0,0,2
415,"Well, they have said it's far from their brief",2,5,2
416,"I haven't had any greater advantage then, Your Honor, in being able to find out exactly where the division lies in the Committee",2,5,2
417,"As a matter of fact, my information up until about two to three weeks ago was that they were not likely to file a brief in connection with the case",2,5,2
418,"Apparently, there was a last minute switch, a brief was filed",2,5,2
419,The brief is addressed primarily as I can see it to this trial-type hearing problem,2,2,2
420,"They -- if I can go back to a period say about 35 years ago, when I studying with Mr",2,5,2
421,"Justice Douglas at Columbia Law School, I might say this, at that time I learned not to over generalize and I think that --
Pardon?
Yeah",0,0,2
422,And I should say that the over generalization that might result from the presentation of facts by the Bill of Rights Committee is that,1,10,2
423,"because this is a specific type of investigation, a hearing is required",1,10,2
424,"Now I think if we read carefully what Your Honor said the Second Canningsberg case with Justice Frankfurter has said, or Justice Cardozo said, when he was a Judge of the Court of Appeals for the State of New York, McCollum case, it will be fairly clear that the tradition in this specific type of investigation has been for the responsibility to be placed with the members of the Bar or the Court to find out and ascertain the information that was available about a particular applicant and if issues arise with relation to them, it seems to me that it is not beyond the procedures that were available without specific rule, without specific statute in New York",2,5,2
425,-- For the Court to give any man who says that he has been denied a hearing on any subject and under appropriate circumstances where the Court deems it essential or proper to even require cross examination of persons who filed complaints as to which an adjudication maybe necessary before a determination of character,0,0,2
426,"You are absolutely right Your Honor, not incorrect",1,12,2
427,Yeah,1,12,2
428,"No what you have here now Your Honor is an application for a leave or permission to renew an application for admission to the Bar, 25 years after it was first denied",2,2,2
429,"Well, that may have been due to his own awkwardness in applying to the Court",2,5,2
430,"Well, it depends upon timeliness; it depends upon all of the other facts that are contained in the record",1,8,2
431,"I don't think that that has been done,",1,10,2
432,but I think that some of these papers indicate that he had a very clear idea of why his application had been denied,0,0,2
433,"Let me go back to 1943, when he made his application in 1943 to the Court, he said -- so that committee can be properly apprised of the various places at which he has resided",2,5,2
434,"since the termination of the prior date, prior proceedings and hearings in 1939",2,2,2
435,"If instant awareness at that time of the necessity and of giving the committee up-to-date information, which was what he hadn't done originally and he set forth as to the second matter, which he acknowledged had been stressed by the committee, “My failure to state or to explain more fully the nature of certain litigation in which I had participated at or about the time of my consideration before a set committee",0,0,2
436,A particular enquiry was made of me by the Clerk and of the Character Committee during such time as to moneys owed by me and litigation pending,2,5,2
437,"”
The Committee made no findings at that time",1,10,2
438,It just supplied a confidential report to the Court and that report indicated all sorts of other conduct between 1938 and 1943,2,5,2
439,"No, no more than this Court did in 1954, when it denied certiorari to this applicant the first time",2,2,2
440,"This Court denied --
There is a slight difference Your Honor",0,0,2
441,That's right,1,10,2
442,To the Character Committee,2,2,2
443,Right,1,12,2
444,Right,1,12,2
445,Right,1,12,2
446,Right,1,12,2
447,"By reason of different conduct --
That's right",2,5,2
448,Yes sir,1,12,2
449,"That's right, that's right",2,5,2
450,"They have submitted and whether they are or not it depends upon that type of conduct, that's right",2,3,2
451,That's right,1,10,2
452,"That's substantially an outline of the record with an omission of the details as to the nature of the misconduct that was involved and without a consideration of whether the conduct that he was guilty of in the first instance, which was clearly reflected in the record not as to the details with -- as to which there might be a dispute was the type of conduct which might be considered by the Appellate Division in connection with his application for leave to renew, as the type of conduct that might be akin to cancerous misconduct or whatever it was conduct that was trivial that might be overlooked, where the man quoted some later date in someway reprieve themselves",2,5,2
453,"Now they -- and in connection with an application to renewal, I assume that the basic problem before the Court is whether this man is entitled to another opportunity to appeal before our Character Committee at this late date",0,0,2
454,"That is something that seems to me, which is purely discretionary and which should be left to the discretion of the State Admitting Court",1,10,2
455,Thank you,0,0,2
456,Mr,0,0,3
457,"Kneedler, what is your understanding of the source of the Indian tribal immunity?
Where did it come from?
Well, that's statutory",2,5,3
458,"May I ask you on that, supposing the State had seized a shipment of cigarettes destined for the tribe and presumably owned by the tribe,",2,5,3
459,because they would shipped by a common carrier and,2,5,3
460,the property would presumably pass at the time of shipment,2,5,3
461,"And the tribe brought suit and said, give us back our cigarettes",2,5,3
462,"We have sovereign immunity and, therefore, our property is immune from seizure of this kind",2,5,3
463,"How would you decide that case?
Well, then what remedy does the State have?
How can they collect their tax?
I thought you said they could seize cigarettes,",2,5,3
464,but now you say they can't,0,0,3
465,But they'll still lose is that what's you're saying,2,2,3
466,Yes,1,12,3
467,But they could have done with the same result is the problem I suppose,1,10,3
468,Mr,0,0,4
469,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
A flight attendant's refusal to assist an ill passenger can amount to an accident within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention",2,3,4
470,"The analysis focuses on whether such conduct is, objectively speaking, unusual or unexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices in the industry and other indicia of what would be expected in the circumstances",1,10,4
471,"At a minimum it's reasonable to construe the convention's term accident, as the United States construes it, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the flight crew, and this Court has ordinarily accorded weight to the United States' reasonable construction of treaties to which it is a party",1,10,4
472,Our reading of the term accident comports with the text structure and purposes of the convention,1,10,4
473,The term is a broad and inclusive one,1,10,4
474,It's not confined to crashes or explosions or equipment failures,2,2,4
475,"As the Court recognized in Saks, it can encompass a wide array of unusual and unexpected events external to the passenger potentially",2,2,4
476,Yes,1,12,4
477,"I think that a failure of an airline employee to come to the assistance of a passenger can, indeed, be an accident",1,10,4
478,"One must recall that even under the common law, common carriers such as airlines have been understood to have special obligations toward their passengers, not expansive obligations to act as physicians to them,",1,10,4
479,but to provide reasonable first aid until they reach the destination,0,0,4
480,So I think that,0,0,4
481,that this particular context is,0,0,4
482,is quite different from the context when one is dealing with just a bystander,1,9,4
483,"And I think under the common law as well, there have been other situations that might well be viewed as accidents that involved omissions when one is under a duty to act",2,5,4
484,"Well, I think the inquiry here",1,10,4
485,"Well, I think here under the Warsaw Convention, the term accident has been understood to refer to an unusual, unexpected event",2,2,4
486,"Yes, that would",0,0,4
487,that would seem to be an accident,1,10,4
488,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,4
489,Other circumstances,2,2,4
490,"medical malpractice cases, for example, might be those where an omission of some sort,",2,5,4
491,"because the doctor is under a duty to act, could be viewed as an accident",2,5,4
492,"For example, a failure to diagnose or to treat a particular medical condition until it's too late, if that was negligent, could be an accident",2,5,4
493,We would say that,0,0,4
494,We would say that the test is objective reasonableness which connotes some of the same concepts as negligence does in the common law,1,10,4
495,"Well, not in all circumstances",2,5,4
496,because negligence isn't a necessary condition for an accident to occur,2,5,4
497,An accident could be an act of God and an event that did not involve negligence,2,2,4
498,"In this particular case, yes, the inquiry into due care and the inquiry into an",2,5,4
499,"whether an accident has occurred are quite similar,",1,8,4
500,but they're still focused on a different question,0,0,4
501,"The accident inquiry asks whether something unusual or unexpected has happened, and the due care inquiry under article 20 asks whether the airline has acted with due care",2,5,4
502,Correct,2,3,4
503,"Now, there may be isolated instances where although ordinary practices were being followed, those practices were so deficient that, nonetheless, an accident might be found",2,5,4
504,"Normally, however, I think that",0,0,4
505,that airlines' practices are to treat passengers reasonably,1,10,4
506,So I think that asking the reasonableness question would be the same as,1,10,4
507,as seeing whether there was a deviation from standard policies and practices,2,5,4
508,In construing the,0,0,4
509,"Well, of course, in this case we don't have a mere negligent omission",1,10,4
510,We have what the district court found to be willful misconduct,2,5,4
511,We also found,0,0,4
512,this case also involves a,1,10,4
513,"a refusal to act, a series of refusals to act, and",0,0,4
514,and provision of misinformation about whether the flight was completely full or not,2,5,4
515,So it's,0,0,4
516,it's difficult to characterize this particular case,1,8,4
517,I don't think it's properly characterized as an omission when there were three increasingly desperate requests to reseat the passenger and the flight attendant responded on each occasion,2,5,4
518,"I think that this sort of case can be contrasted, for example, from a",1,8,4
519,a simple failure to warn case where the question is whether an airline should have warned about a particular medical condition that a passenger might have in response to ordinary flight,1,10,4
520,This seems to involve much more,1,10,4
521,Certainly Lord Phillips in the English court of appeals thought that this case involved much more than,2,2,4
522,than just a failure to act,1,10,4
523,The drafters of the Warsaw Convention certainly didn't intend that airlines would be insurers for any harm that befell a passenger during flight,2,2,4
524,"They did intend, however, that airlines would be held liable when their own fault caused a passenger's death or bodily injury",2,2,4
525,"Indeed, they eliminated the caps on damages in cases when that fault rose to the level of willful misconduct",2,5,4
526,This would seem doubtful that the drafters intended simply by their choice of the term accident to exempt airlines entirely from liability in cases where passengers died or suffered bodily injury,1,10,4
527,"because of the airline's fault, including willful misconduct in this case",2,5,4
528,"It could well be an accident, Your Honor",2,5,4
529,It might not be an accident for which liability would,2,5,4
530,would be properly,1,10,4
531,"Yes, it probably would",1,12,4
532,That's correct,1,12,4
533,because the airlines have the opportunity under article 20 of the convention to come back and say that we cannot be held responsible for this accident,2,5,4
534,because we did not act negligently,2,5,4
535,The understanding,1,8,4
536,"Well, the term in the treaty is all necessary measures",1,10,4
537,But it's been construed to mean all reasonable measures,1,10,4
538,So it's essentially been understood as a,1,8,4
539,a due care defense,2,5,4
540,"And that's reinforced in the Montreal Convention, the new convention that has just come into force, that",0,0,4
541,that uses the term negligence in its own words,1,10,4
542,The understanding that the accident requirement can be satisfied in cases like this one serves the convention's purpose of balancing the interests of air carriers and passengers,1,10,4
543,Such cases do not pose a threat of particularly expansive liability to airlines,1,10,4
544,"Cases such as this one where air carriers do something that is unusual and unexpected and thereby cause a passenger's death or bodily injury can be expected to remain relatively few under the convention, as they are under U",2,2,4
545,S,0,0,4
546,domestic law,2,3,4
547,"Imposing liability, meanwhile, enables passengers and their families to receive some measure of compensation for their injuries and provides appropriate incentives for airline supervision and",1,10,4
548,and training of their personnel,2,2,4
549,"For all of these reasons, we'd ask the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed",2,5,4
550,Mr,0,0,5
551,Chief Justice and may it please the Court,2,3,5
552,I think this case is a little different from the one you just heard,1,10,5
553,"In this case, there was an action brought by Mr",2,5,5
554,Jenkins who as an Assistant City Attorney in the City of Birmingham in Equity court seeking to permanently enjoin the maintenance of a nuisance at the Pussycat Adult Theater and a Bookstore,2,5,5
555,The State of Alabama unlike the State of Ohio was proceeding under the Red Light Abatement Statute,2,5,5
556,There was no provision for a one year closing,2,2,5
557,There was no maximum or minimum set,2,2,5
558,This was simply and purely going under the Red Light Abatement Statute,1,10,5
559,The proof in this case was adduced by Mr,1,8,5
560,"Jenkins was that, certain people who worked for the corporation had been convicted in the Recorder's Court which is the first level of court for violation of the obscenity laws of the City of the Birmingham",2,3,5
561,They have a city ordinance for violation of obscenity laws,2,2,5
562,There were approximately 15 cases which have been made most of which have been tried before the Recorder's Court,2,2,5
563,All of which had been appealed at the -- or were in the process of being appealed,2,5,5
564,"Since that time, the only three cases with the appeal Your Honors goes to de novo to the next court -- Circuit Court and which there is a jury trial on issue of obscenity and parenthetically speaking the only three cases are going to trial all resulted in acquittals for the defendant",2,2,5
565,"But yet, it was this evidence of the violation of the -- alleged violation of the law before the Recorder's Court and instead of the other 12 that were still pending and have not yet been tried in the Circuit Court",2,5,5
566,"So, every -- what we have is the evidence of convictions that the lowest court when appeals were allowable in the next level with the Circuit Court",2,5,5
567,"That was the criminal process, what the prosecution or what Mr",2,2,5
568,Jenkins tried to do here was a civil proceeding and a purely civil proceeding which is not ipso facto or necessarily ancillary to the enforcement of the criminal laws,1,10,5
569,because the criminal laws were proceeding and the rational is proceeding in the state court,2,5,5
570,But what he did is attempt to go in and to close up the theater,2,5,5
571,because yesterday they sold obscene books or films which they exhibited and tomorrow you may do so,2,2,5
572,"The --
Yes, sir",0,0,5
573,"It's entirely different and I --
No, sir and the State of Alabama has not interpreted its Red Light Abatement statute to include or exclude",2,2,5
574,"Because that's the term that it was given at the time, it was originally passed Your Honor",2,2,5
575,"It was designed to close beer house, saloons, pool halls and places of prostitution where you punish somebody for having gone, committed prostitution, they go back and open up again and open up again and open up again, you try to close that business",2,2,5
576,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
577,There is a new address,2,5,5
578,It has a theater that is operated by one corporation,2,2,5
579,There is bookstore in the lobby that is operated by another corporation much like these Gem Department Stores where there are at least sections in the store,2,2,5
580,"This is what we had at this particular location, two corporations, one location, one operating the theater and one operating the bookstore",2,2,5
581,"It never interpreted that question of whether or not their statute applies to theaters, adult theaters and adult bookstores",2,2,5
582,"We -- in the equity proceeding, yes sir",2,5,5
583,That was raised,1,10,5
584,but the judge issued a temporary restraining order that is all that is involved,2,2,5
585,"Here is the temporary restraining order which we have placed at the beginning of the appendix in this case, order upon prayer for temporary injunction",2,2,5
586,"Now, incidentally Your Honors --
Yes, Your Honor that's true",0,0,5
587,This was notice and hearing,2,2,5
588,"Yes sir, much like our -- I think Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure kind of thing where an attempt is made to notify the other people",2,3,5
589,"Now, in the -- what counsel then did on behalf of MTM and the other plaintiff is to file an action in federal court prior to the issuance of the temporary restraining order and which it asked for the convocation of three-judge court to determine constitutionality of the utilization of the Red Light Statute either as written or as applied by the prosecutor in this particular case",2,2,5
590,"The -- there was a co-defendant, I'm sorry -- a co-plaintiff separate case entirely different by the name of General Corporation which had faced the same problem and I think some Huntsville, Alabama and in that case, they also were closed by court order and the three-judge federal court joined both cases for the purpose of argument and disposition",2,2,5
591,"And thus, the decision in essence applies to both sets of cases",1,10,5
592,"Again, parenthetically speaking we proceeded remaining the MTM and the other corporation operating the theater and bookstore preceded by following a jurisdictional statement and sought to seek the relief for this Court from the denial of the injunction",2,5,5
593,The other corporation -- General Corporation decided to go forward in the state courts after the three-judge court threw them out,2,2,5
594,When they did so in spite of the comment by Judge Pointer in his decision that there is a procedure in Alabama where you can sort of expedite your -- that's on page A-99 of the appendix,2,5,5
595,He said that in Alabama permanent injunctions are appealable and temporary injunctions may be made appealable by appropriate motions and both types of appeals are given expedited preferential treatment by statute,2,2,5
596,"Now, let me tell you about the preferential treatment by statute --
That's on A-99 and A-100 Your Honor of the appendix of appellants",2,5,5
597,I'm quoting from Judge Pointer's ruling,1,10,5
598,"Yes, sir and the -- what I said in to the Court is that the co-plaintiff General Corporation thereafter appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court",2,5,5
599,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
600,This -- it was a co-plaintiff in the same case,2,2,5
601,It was not an appeal from the same judgment,2,5,5
602,That was in Huntsville,2,2,5
603,Pardon me,2,3,5
604,Huntsville,2,2,5
605,In the District Court,2,2,5
606,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
607,"Yes, that's correct",1,12,5
608,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
609,"After the three-judge court denied the injunction, they then entered an appeal in the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama",2,3,5
610,Closing in Huntsville,2,2,5
611,Permanent injunction there sir,2,5,5
612,"(Voice Overlap)
No sir, we did not",0,0,5
613,There is no -- we suggest there is no appeal for a temporary injunction in the State of Alabama there is a -- you can file a separate motion to dissolve which is a separate proceeding,1,10,5
614,but Your Honors we had filed our federal suit prior to that temporary injunction,0,0,5
615,"Alright, --
After the three-judge court said, we deny the injunction",0,0,5
616,"He then appealed to the Supreme Court for the State of Alabama and Your Honors that appeal was argued October 15, 1974 and there is no and has been no disposition --
The appeal was not dismissed, there was the appeal brought by general from a final order in their case --
Yes, sir",2,3,5
617,That's correct,1,12,5
618,But what I'm pointing out is that although Judge Pointer says that these things can be given expedited preferential treatment by statute,1,10,5
619,The truth of the matter is that case still has not been decided,1,10,5
620,"But I'm always saying sir that one of the reasons why the court said, “Well, maybe we ought not deal with this question",0,0,5
621,"”
It's",0,0,5
622,because there is a basis where you can go for an appeal that is expedited in preferential and I'm saying that although that may be true in theory is not true in fact,2,2,5
623,"Yes, sir and that --
It could be Your Honor",2,5,5
624,but I say that October 15th was the day of the argument and that's October 1974 and this decision by Judge Pointer was October 1973,0,0,5
625,"So, it took a full year after which to give it that expedited preferential treatment is what I'm talking about",1,10,5
626,"No, sir",0,0,5
627,I think we have a different prospect here,1,8,5
628,"Yes,",0,0,5
629,but then we have the Younger versus Harris problem,0,0,5
630,It will be (Voice Overlap),2,3,5
631,"Well, I just happen to think they're not",1,10,5
632,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
633,We're not in trouble sir,1,10,5
634,because we still have the permanent injunction which is not yet been heard,2,5,5
635,"We think that that's the primary question, Your Honor",1,8,5
636,"That's what they said, yes sir",2,5,5
637,"However, the Court would disagree that it's quasi-criminal",1,10,5
638,"because this unlike the --
I think it was the view that they placed on it Your Honor",2,5,5
639,because they took the Fifth Circuit decision of Palaio versus McAuliffe and I think they misapplied that particular case,2,5,5
640,because if the court will look at that case,2,5,5
641,What occurred there is there were independent seizures and aid of the criminal process which was the first step in making a criminal case to have a trial -- a criminal trial and counsel in that case rushed in the federal court and said this was improper and sought to seek the aid of the federal court,2,5,5
642,Judge Edenfield denied that aid,2,3,5
643,"because he said, this is part of the criminal process, you can vindicate your right ultimately in the criminal process",1,10,5
644,"We cannot vindicate our right in a criminal process and I think that the Fifth Circuit case is not applicable to, I say, its good law",1,10,5
645,But it is not applicable to this situation,1,10,5
646,because the criminal process is going on independent Your Honors of what is attempted here in this particular case,2,2,5
647,This Court has said that in even in a criminal case in Younger -- in Mitchum versus Foster referring towards Younger versus Harris doctrine,2,2,5
648,"It talks about the fact that even if in criminal case the court purely clear left room for federal injunctive intervention in a pending state court prosecution and certain exceptional circumstances where reputable injury is both great and immediate and where the state law has flagrantly and patently violative expressed constitutional provision or where there's a showing of bad faith, harassment, or other unusual circumstances that we call for equitable relief",2,5,5
649,"Yes sir, that is correct",1,12,5
650,I had a brief moment to review it,1,10,5
651,"I know that the Court --
No sir, it was not",2,5,5
652,"Right,",0,0,5
653,but they did not say we do not have standing to be before the Court in that case,2,2,5
654,"In fact, --
They did not raise -- say that we had no standing to be before the Court in that case that we had not raised substantial question",2,5,5
655,"(Voice Overlap)
Yes, sir",0,0,5
656,The Court did say and I point at A-100 of the appendix that there is a question as to whether the Alabama nuisance statute here in question are “flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions,2,5,5
657,"”
In this particular concept, they go on to say it may be possible the Alabama Supreme Court might construe these statutes as in applicable",2,2,5
658,"So, they expressed no opinion on the particular merits to this particular case",2,5,5
659,"So, we say Your Honors that under the decision of Zwickler versus Koota authored by Mr",0,0,5
660,Justice Brennan,1,10,5
661,We chose the forum of the federal courts,2,2,5
662,We did so,1,12,5
663,because there was no order against us at that time so to speak and this was a -- we think a purely civil case putting the title on quasi-criminal,1,10,5
664,"I think it's a misapplication of the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Palaio versus McAuliffe and we feel that even if the court agreed with the determination interpreting a statute is being quasi-criminal, we think that we still have demonstrated the extra ordinary circumstances and that is to say that the total closing and succession",1,10,5
665,"And the point is you can operate anything, I mean you can put in -- if you put in carnal knowledge and the Judge Barbour felt that carnal knowledge might have offended the law prior to this Court's decision in June",2,5,5
666,He could've held the employees and contempt and put them in jail immediately for civil contempt,2,3,5
667,because they had shown the movie which he later thought might possibly be obscene,2,3,5
668,And the theaters have been closed from May 1973 to the present time,2,2,5
669,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
670,"Yes sir, that's correct",1,12,5
671,"And of course we -- when we participated -- counsel participated in the proceedings before Judge Barbour, he did so in citing of course England versus Board of Medical Examiners where there",2,5,5
672,because we have to be,2,5,5
673,We -- we do not wish to abandon the jurisdiction of the federal court that we're trying to acquire and try to promote our cause that way,2,2,5
674,There is no need to sir,1,10,5
675,I pretend,1,9,5
676,because we have a temporary restrain injunction,2,5,5
677,There is no appeal from the temporary injunction,2,5,5
678,We must do something affirmative that is to say file a motion to (Voice Overlap),1,10,5
679,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
680,"No sir, we took the position that under England versus Board of Medical Examiners if we took that affirmative action we might very well be then usurp it at the jurisdiction of the federal court",2,5,5
681,"And thus, we can't very well take the affirmative action in citing England versus Board of Medical Examiners at the same time in order to go for with them",2,5,5
682,"So, we did not for that reason, sir",0,0,5
683,"No, sir",0,0,5
684,"Yes, sir",0,0,5
685,"Yes, I would appreciate that",1,12,5

693,2d 611,0,0,5
694,"In that case, the federal court -- Fifth Circuit held that the state has a right to use its nuisance law -- public nuisance law and a manner to where here there was drive-in theater, it was showing X-rated films, there were traffic problems being created and in that specific instance much like I think the case crime in Rabe from the State of Washington, Rabe versus Washington where Mr",2,2,5
695,"Chief Justice Burger, I think pointed out that that could be a special problem that might be resolved by nuisance actions",2,2,5
696,That is not involved here,1,10,5
697,We have theater it's closed,2,2,5
698,"I know sir, there're young people going by and of course the same thing would be necessary true here",1,10,5
699,"So, I don't think that this decision of 80 Drive-in Inc",1,10,5
700,versus Baxley and I was referring to the Court's concurring opinion and there where you talked I believe about the fact that this could be dealt and might be dealt with this nuisance and I think that's what that decision holds for and I don't think it's applicable to the case here at bar,0,0,5
701,"Secondly, I understand from Mr",0,0,5
702,-- from counsel that there has been no stipulation entered into by the parties that the judge on his motion Judge Barbour on his motion has continued the hearing or any permanent injunction,2,5,5
703,We are not going to ask for it unless we be usurp from our federal court jurisdiction and I suppose the prosecution is not asked for,1,10,5
704,And we suggest in final conclusion that the Court dismissed our case and we feel that if they felt that the State Supreme Court should rule on the matter abstention and they abstained then they should've retained jurisdiction under the theory of law,2,5,5
705,but this Court has espoused including more recently American Trial Lawyers Association versus the New Jersey Supreme Court,2,2,5
706,We think the Court erred absolutely flat out dismissing the case and should have retained jurisdiction,1,10,5
707,"Yes,",0,0,5
708,but if the Court if you will remember the opinion of the judge they suggested and it was a mixed bag that in this instance we have not gotten to a Younger versus Harris problem,2,2,5
709,but we hadn't got into the special circumstances there,0,0,5
710,because the state court could construe the statute in a manner which would take the federal constitutional question out of it,2,5,5
711,"And if it did that, then the special circumstances in Younger v",0,0,5
712,Harris are not present,2,2,5
713,"So, that's why I'm saying it is relevant and that's the point I was making that I felt that under those circumstances then this is not -- they were not deciding it on pure Younger grounds and I think under this circumstance, they should retain jurisdiction even if not dismissed",0,0,5

--thinks I'd certainly like this money in the estate--
--I want him to bring the lawsuit",2,5,6
716,"What happens?
Can the creditor sue General Motors directly?
Yes, and what's the answer?
So the creditor can bring his own lawsuit in that case for the benefit of the estate",2,5,6
717,because the trustee wouldn't,2,5,6
718,And you say that's really the same principle here,1,10,6
719,"Well, what happens in",2,5,6
720,"I don't know that that Meyer case really answers the question,",1,10,6

--and the trustee doesn't bring the claim, and one of the creditors says, I'd like to bring it",0,0,6
722,"Now, Meyer dealt with the case of the debtor having filed the suit, not a creditor",2,5,6
723,It could be taken as authority for the creditor,2,5,6
724,"So what happens?
Is it the case that creditors in such circumstances simply go and bring their own lawsuits in the name of the estate instead of the trustee doing it?
I know,",0,0,6
725,"but what I'm trying to do for my own purposes is to find an analogy, and I know it's a rough analogy,",0,0,6
726,"but I would like to know just for my own purposes what happens, and it must happen often, of when a trustee doesn't bring a lawsuit to get some money for the estate, that a big creditor thinks he ought to bring",0,0,6
727,Does bankruptcy normally work,2,2,6
728,this can't be unusual,1,8,6
729,And in such circumstances there are two possibilities,1,8,6
730,One is that you bring a suit to sue the trustee and make him do it,1,10,6
731,"Another possibility is, you bring your own lawsuit",2,5,6
732,but it,0,0,6
733,somehow you're standing in the shoes of the trustee,2,2,6

--Fine",0,0,6
737,Okay,1,12,6
738,Fine,1,12,6
739,"Now, if that's so in that circumstance, why shouldn't that be so in this circumstance?
And now, in your view as a bankruptcy lawyer, if they had, I mean, is that a good way to resolve the problem?
You say, look, you're a creditor",0,0,6
740,You're a post petition creditor,2,5,6
741,"You have a right to get your money,",1,10,6

743,"because otherwise there are going to be those leeches, you know, or there are going to be all these people running around",2,3,6
744,"Is that a good resolution?
Is it the case that if the trustee",0,0,6
745,the trustee himself goes and brings this lawsuit against Justice,2,5,6
746,she can do it,1,9,6
747,"I mean, the trustee can do this under 506(c)",1,10,6
748,"And, say, collects $10 million, which happened to be the cost of the contracted-for clean-up",2,5,6
749,All right,1,12,6
750,So now there's $10 million in the trustee's hand,2,5,6
751,"Now, there are another $20 million of administrative expenses that were not related to preserving the property",2,5,6
752,"Now, does that $10 million",2,5,6
753,"does the trustee give that $10 million to the toxic waste contractor that helped to preserve the property, or does that toxic waste contractor get only one-third and two-thirds has to go to these other administrative claimants who had nothing to do with preserving the property?
Well, that's all right",2,5,6
754,"I don't object to find--
--It does",2,5,6
755,But then there's,0,0,6
756,"that--
--Yes",0,0,6
757,"Yes, mm-hmm",2,5,6

--All right, so the",0,0,6
759,(c) has as its purpose simply getting money from the secured creditor into the estate,1,10,6
760,It doesn't have as its purpose giving that money to the people who incurred the expense,1,8,6
761,Is different,1,8,6
762,Wow,1,12,6

Was the prior practice that when the",0,0,6

765,"nonsecured, sorry",2,5,6
766,"The toxic waste person sues against the collateral, and apparently can get the money",2,5,6
767,"Did that toxic waste person get to keep the whole thing, or did the toxic waste person have to put it in the estate and share it with the other nonrelated administrative claimants?
No, no, it wouldn't have been toxic waste",2,5,6
768,"What I mean is, a person--
--A 506(c)",2,2,6
769,"a 506(c) creditor, and then there are non-506(c)'s,",0,0,6

What happened?
So this is quite--
--Why would you want to allow such a person, i",0,0,6

774,Mr,0,0,7
775,"Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has said repeatedly, quote
""as a general rule, a defendant should not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal",2,2,7
776,"""
and has recognized that Texas procedure make it quote,
""virtually impossible for appellate counsel to adequately present such a claim",2,5,7
777,"""
Those claims of the choices made by the sovereign State of Texas and it renders this case just like Martinez",2,5,7
778,This case well illustrates the consequences of that choice,1,8,7
779,"The transcript in this case was not ready, available for 7 months",2,3,7
780,That's 4 1/2 months after the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on any new trial motion,2,5,7
781,"The State itself argued, quote, in Sprouse,
""Without access to that record, new counsel would have little basis for attacking the performance of trial counsel",2,5,7
782,"""
Texas systemically channels ineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State habeas",2,5,7
783,"It's not just them saying it in words,",1,8,7
784,but it's also saying it in the legislation and in the rules that the State of Texas has adopted,2,2,7
785,"In order to expand the record in a Wiggins claim, which is what's the basis of Mr",2,2,7
786,"Trevino's claim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day window to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days -- 75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses jurisdiction by operation of law",2,5,7
787,That's correct,1,12,7
788,And so you couldn't expand the record,2,2,7
789,"And in order to present a Wiggins claim especially, it takes a considerable amount of extra record investigation",2,5,7
790,"After 75 days, the district court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there are some jurisdictions around the country that have that opportunity,",2,2,7
791,but Texas has a finality where there is no provision to expand the record after that 75-day period,0,0,7
792,That's correct,1,12,7
793,"Well, there's two -- actually, Texas has a dual track system",2,2,7
794,"It was developed in 1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in AEDPA",2,2,7
795,"And the concept -- and the reason for it, the rationale was to expedite these type of claims, especially in death penalty claims under Section 11",1,10,7
796,"071,",0,0,7
797,but the -- and the purpose is that there is two counsels that are appointed,0,0,7
798,"One counsel is appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's done on direct appeal",2,2,7
799,"The other counsel is appointed in all cases, there's no question, on habeas",2,5,7
800,"And that attorney, that counsel is appointed with the understanding that he's going to have the time to do the extra-record based claims",2,2,7
801,"In a case like this, the record wasn't even prepared for seven months after the date of the judgment",2,5,7
802,"That's correct,",0,0,7
803,"because the -- the scheme that Texas has developed systemically channels the habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective assistance claim, into habeas",2,2,7
804,There is no -- to say that it could be done is really an illusion,1,10,7
805,"Well, it wouldn't really affect 50 States",1,10,7
806,because some States provide a mechanism for an abatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand the record,2,5,7
807,Other States require that it go to direct appeal,2,2,7
808,And each -- and those States made -- have made a choice,1,8,7
809,And Texas has made a choice by developing this scheme,1,10,7
810,"And as far as the other States, they would have to compare themselves to the situation that -- that we would -- that would come out of this",2,5,7
811,When it makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases to raise the claim on direct appeal,2,2,7
812,"Well, not necessarily--
--Justice Alito,",0,0,7
813,because there's -- some States require that their cases are directed back to -- to direct appeal and there's a mechanism to expand the record,2,2,7
814,There is some -- there is -- some require it to go to direct appeal,2,2,7
815,"But in Texas, what we have is a limitation that's the rules that Texas Supreme Court has devised, with Texas--
--If the -- let me make sure I understand",0,0,7
816,No,1,12,7
817,"Because the new -- the old attorney, the trial attorney is in the worst, really, position to understand his ineffectiveness",2,5,7
818,"There is a disincentive for him--
--And that--
--No,",0,0,7
819,"because that's--
--because that State is -- in the Texas scheme, in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives us another attorney in this dual track, this system, and it's understood that that attorney is the habeas attorney, and he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time limitation that the direct appeal attorney has, that's -- that 75-day limitation",2,2,7
820,But the bottom line in -- in our situation in Texas is that we have a scheme,1,8,7
821,We have a set of -- of laws and -- and rules that channel these type of claims,2,2,7
822,"Well, first of all, the Rule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21",2,2,7
823,8 talk about the limitations of -- the number of days that you have to expand the record in a motion for new trial,2,3,7
824,"75 days, the district court loses jurisdiction, they cannot hear anything else on this case",2,2,7
825,The record in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after the date of the trial,2,5,7
826,"So even with a new attorney that's appointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a stranger to the case",2,5,7
827,He doesn't know anything about the case,2,3,7
828,He's not in a position to talk to the client,2,5,7
829,The client is not the best person to understand the Rules of Appellate Procedure,1,10,7
830,"So he's got to wait on that -- on that trial record, first of all, to see what's there",2,5,7
831,"And then--
--I'm sorry if I missed that,",0,0,7
832,but that's exactly the point,0,0,7
833,"And that's what--
--No",0,0,7
834,Not necessarily,1,8,7
835,"But the -- in the capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track system, where you get an attorney appointed automatically in a habeas setting, where in a non-death penalty setting there is a possibility of getting an attorney in the interest of justice,",2,2,7
836,but it's not always guaranteed,0,0,7
837,"And in that case, the appeal is done in a successive way, not in this dual-track way",2,2,7
838,"And in -- in the death penalty arena, it manifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious that there is a systematic channeling by the State referring these type of claims into habeas, while the State attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses on the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is dealing with all of the case, not just the trial,",2,2,7
839,"but the -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no ineffectiveness on his part, and also to do the investigation on the extra-record-based claims, which takes a substantial amount of time",0,0,7
840,Right,1,12,7
841,"Well, I would suggest--
--Okay",0,0,7
842,I would suggest the rule to be that Martinez applies when a State channels ineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas and makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases to raise the claim on direct appeal,1,10,7
843,"And in answer to your question about all of the States, many of the States do make it -- do make habeas available in the direct appeal arena",2,2,7
844,"Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito, for this reason",2,5,7
845,"Many States have a mechanism, unlike the Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the record",1,10,7
846,"Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus brief, has a Rule 21",2,2,7
847,3 which permits the claimant to go back and expand the record,1,10,7
848,We don't have that ability in Texas,2,5,7
849,Yes,1,12,7
850,"And the reason I say that is, in order to obtain a record, one, you need to, when you file your motion for new trial, you have to specifically set out the factual basis for the claim; and two, the affidavit has to identify the evidence that any further investigation would have revealed",0,0,7
851,So you've got that 30-day window when you file that motion for new trial that you have to do all of those things,2,2,7
852,And that's not enough time,2,5,7
853,"If the--
--Yes,",0,0,7
854,"because the time -- the time, especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in order to be able to prepare and not just the time there,",2,5,7
855,but the time that is imposed by the Rules of -- of Appellate Procedure,2,2,7
856,That 75-day window in order to expand the record is part of this whole system that it's understood that the habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim is channelled into habeas,2,2,7
857,Yes,1,12,7
858,Yes,1,12,7
859,"Well,",0,0,7
860,"but it's a--
--Well, there's a problem with declaring yourself ineffective",0,0,7
861,"One, it's -- it's kind of counterintuitive",2,5,7
862,"In Texas, if you declare yourself ineffective, there's repercussions",2,2,7
863,"You're no longer available to -- you know, be taken off the list to get appointments on these type of claims",2,5,7
864,And -- and it's also against the bar rules to -- to have that adverse interest against your client,2,5,7
865,"Well, that, as far as their State, you know, other States are concerned, you know, those are problems within those States",2,2,7
866,"But as far as Texas is concerned, you know, we are in a situation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez situation where there was no ability to -- to raise -- the system that we have prevents you from raising this claim",2,5,7
867,"And as far as the other States are concerned, some of the States have a more liberal opportunity to -- to expand the record,",2,2,7
868,but that's not the system that we have in Texas,0,0,7
869,"Well, it -- it takes a while",0,0,7
870,"I'm not going to say a long while,",0,0,7
871,"but releases are required, sometimes there's opposition to releasing those records",2,2,7
872,"But the biggest part of this whole problem is getting the record, is also, in our situation, to have Mr",2,5,7
873,"Trevino evaluated regarding his -- there was never a psychological or sociological study done in his case, and to have a psychological eval done, that doesn't happen in 30 days",2,2,7
874,"And one, you've got to get the records and in some of these situations, one record leads to another record, and finding one witness leads to another witness",2,5,7
875,"And by the time you start developing all these other avenues and when you put all that together, then you're in a position to present that to an expert in order to make that sort of evaluation",1,10,7
876,That's correct,1,12,7
877,because the 30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar,2,5,7
878,That's all he has,2,5,7
879,"And in addition, the -- the trial -- the direct appeal attorney has his own responsibilities",2,2,7
880,There's a division of labor that's here that the direct appeal attorney is supposed to review the entire record to look for all of whatever errors that might be there,2,2,7
881,"And while -- and that's why in Texas where you have this dual track system in order to expedite the appeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do the habeas work",2,2,7
882,"Well, it helps our case",1,12,7
883,because it recognizes the dual track system and it recognizes that the extra record under Section 12,2,2,7
884,22 of the guide -- of the Texas guidelines that were formulated that the State bar was -- one of their committees on indigent defense helped develop,2,2,7
885,They recognize the fact that extra record investigation is the responsibility of the habeas counsel,2,2,7
886,I would like to reserve the balance of my time,1,10,7
887,I want to be very clear about this abatement issue,1,10,7
888,"The abatement issue, as Justice Alito just said, is only available as referred in our brief on page 6, is only available when there is a denial of the constitutional right to an attorney",2,5,7
889,And those situations is when there's a delay in appointing the direct appeal attorney after the trial,2,2,7
890,"So during the 30-day window to file the motion for new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that clock is running, and if there's no attorney appointed, the constitutional violation is considered a critical stage of the trial",2,5,7
891,And,0,0,7
892,"since there's -- if there's no attorney appointed during those 30 days, that is the only time, as Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is the time that the abatement procedure is permitted",2,5,7
893,That is the only time,1,10,7
894,And when that new -- that's correct,0,0,7
895,"And if a new attorney is appointed,",0,0,7
896,"because there was no attorney appointed, that new attorney, he himself also has only 30 days",2,5,7
897,"The clock starts--
--That's not true",2,5,7
898,"That is not a correct statement of the law, and I would refer the Court to our briefs, to the -- to the time that the authorities that we cite and also the amicus brief from the State Bar of Texas",2,2,7
899,"To the direct appeal attorney?
Well, they don't -- to do a Wiggins claim, to do -- they're doing things that would -- investigates things that came out of the record,",0,0,7
900,because that's what is relegated to the direct appeal,2,2,7
901,"The habeas attorney has more money available and has more time available to do the things, and it becomes a function of time as well",2,3,7
902,But I want to direct the Court's attention also to the -- to the statement in Sprouse,0,0,7
903,"And -- and the statement--
--In the case of Sprouse in our -- it's page 20 of our reply brief",0,0,7
904,"That the position in Sprouse is that there would be no constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance claim, and that's",1,10,7
905,because the habeas proceeding is available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the proper place to do so,2,2,7
906,And that's the State's brief,2,5,7
907,It's on page 20 of our reply brief,2,5,7
908,The other thing that I wanted to bring to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're aberrations and they really don't -- shouldn't --,2,2,7
909,"since this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not the aberrational",2,2,7
910,And that's exactly what we have here,2,2,7
911,"The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice here that the State has systemically developed a system that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims, the Wiggins-type claims, and that the claims that are raised on the record go to the direct appeal attorney",1,10,7
912,That is the system that the State has developed,2,2,7
913,"Those are the rules that govern this system that have been promulgated by the court of criminal appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system, the scheme that we are under",2,2,7
914,"And because--
--We're just looking for the --",0,0,7
915,"because of the procedural defaults scenario that we find ourselves in, we tried to do that",2,5,7
916,And -- and,0,0,7
917,because 1107,0,0,7
918,"1 also has -- when they -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to expedite these claims, it provided three things: One, a new attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and three, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 58, which is what we met in -- in our case",0,0,7
919,"The Texas scheme,",0,0,7
920,"because of that abuse of the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and that puts us in this quandary where a person like Mr",2,5,7
921,Trevino is unable to get relief,2,3,7
922,"because he has an ineffective trial lawyer and now he is -- that ineffective trial lawyer, his ineffectiveness is being insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas lawyer",2,5,7
923,And that's not what should happen,2,5,7
924,"It's -- it's just not equitable, it's not fair",2,5,7
925,And Mr,0,0,7
926,"Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a right to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial lawyer",2,5,7
927,Mr,0,0,8
928,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--
Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority over immigration enacted section 1231(a)(6) in 196",2,3,8
929,1996 to afford the Attorney General the authority to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the 90 day removal period if they cannot be removed to their countries of nationality or to some other country during that 90 day period,2,2,8
930,That enactment was the culmination of measures beginning in 1988 by which Congress sought to address what had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within the United States,2,2,8
931,"It was enacted against a background of information in 1996 in particular, about both the high rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the very high rate of flight among aliens who are released",2,2,8
932,Yes,1,12,8
933,"It does not, no,",1,12,8
934,but what I,0,0,8
935,"the important element, though, is that future dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain someone",1,10,8
936,"Under this Court's civil commitment cases, and this does not remotely resemble civil commitment",2,2,8
937,"because it's an exercise of Congress' plenary power over immigration,",2,2,8
938,but one of the bases on which someone may be civilly committed is their potential dangerousness,2,5,8
939,"Now, the Court--
--No",0,0,8
940,"That's--
--No, it is in this important respect, and I think this is a critical factor to understanding this case",1,10,8
941,"What the Court said in Hendricks, for example, is that in the civil commitment cases the Court has said it's dangerousness plus some other factor, such as mental illness",2,2,8
942,"Here we have a critical other factor, in addition to dangerousness, and that is that both Mr",2,5,8
943,Ma and Mr,0,0,8
944,Zadvydas in this case had had their right to remain in this country extinguished,2,5,8
945,"Pardon me?
In our submission the detention of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for detention, as long as there is a basis for concern about threat to the community and removal",1,10,8
946,Right,1,12,8
947,Right,1,12,8
948,It is not clear now,2,2,8
949,"Well--
--That, and in addition,",0,0,8
950,because of the potential for dangerousness to the community,2,5,8
951,"Well--
--I'd like to answer that in two respects",0,0,8
952,I do not believe there is any reasonable time limitation within the statute,1,10,8
953,"On the other hand, it depends what you mean, what could be comprehended within the determination of reasonableness",1,8,8
954,"I mean, for example--
--Well, in this case the attorney--
--Yes",2,5,8
955,The Attorney General has implemented this statute in a way,1,10,8
956,"maybe the Attorney General had broader authority to detain someone permanently without ever releasing someone,",2,3,8
957,"but the constitutional question before the court, and the statutory question for that matter, has to be analyzed in terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of his discretion in establishing a review procedure under which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight",1,10,8
958,I do not agree with it in this respect,1,10,8
959,"We do not believe it is for the courts to determine whether, at least in the first instance and without a high degree of deference to the Attorney General as to whether there is another country to whom the alien might conceivably be returned in the future",1,10,8
960,I'm not,1,9,8
961,"I ""m not""",1,9,8
962,"That is our position,",0,0,8
963,"but I would like to say something about the two aliens in this case, just to show that we're not even near that position",0,0,8
964,Contrary to Mr,2,5,8
965,"Zadvydas's counsel's position that nothing has been done with respect to him recently, we point out at page 48, footnote 22 of our brief, facts have happened after the letter that he referred to that Mr",1,9,8
966,Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate,2,2,8
967,"As we point out in that brief, the INS twice last summer called Mr",2,5,8
968,"Zadvydas in for an appointment, after he asked that that appointment be postponed, so it could be explained to him what information the INS had obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his parents",2,2,8
969,"On both instances, he did not show up for the appointment, so he is not cooperating with the known procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has identified as germane to the question of whether he would be granted citizenship",2,5,8
970,"It is,",0,0,8
971,"but the important purpose of the detention here is to protect the community as a prophylactic matter, not simply to take measures against someone after the fact",2,2,8
972,"Now, having said that, under the regulations that I've described, even before the formal regulations went in place in December, up to 50 percent of the people who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were in place were released during that period of time, so these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity--
--I'm not",2,5,8
973,"well, all of them, or almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted of a crime",2,5,8
974,"Most of the people detained in this category have a criminal history, maybe a few who do not,",2,5,8
975,"but the two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a crime in which they had all of the procedures to which they were entitled in determining that, and this Court has said--
--They have,",0,0,8
976,"but as this Court pointed out in the Jones case, which was discussed in Foucha, it is permissible for a State to presume continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime, and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness",0,0,8
977,"Oh, I think there are several",1,8,8
978,I think the Mezei case does,1,9,8
979,"But it is our submission that once an alien has been ordered removed from the country, as both of the aliens here have been",2,5,8
980,"not only have they had a criminal conviction, with all the protection that affords,",2,5,8
981,but they have,0,0,8
982,are subject to final orders of removal under an administrative process in which that had be proven by clear and convincing evidence,2,5,8
983,The procedures are unquestioned in this case,1,10,8
984,"The consequence of the final order of removal--
--There's not, and if I may explain why, there is no difference from the point of view of the status or the interests of the alien, there is no difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the United States, and there is no difference--
--I'm speaking of the legal status of the alien, and the third is with respect to the interests of the United States",0,0,8
985,"With respect to the status of the alien, it's important to consider the consequences of a final order of removal",1,10,8
986,It is not simply an order of removal,1,10,8
987,"It also terminates the person's status as a lawful, permanent resident",2,5,8
988,"If I may, this does not rest on a legal fiction",1,10,8
989,"The first thing I would like to point out is, just to finish the",1,10,8
990,because this is important to answering the question,2,2,8
991,"to finish the consequences of a final order of removal, the first thing it does, as I mentioned, is, it terminates the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence--
--which is defined as a privilege of being lawfully admitted, such status not having changed, and as we point out in our brief--
--Right,",0,0,8
992,"but then the further consequence is, under 1182(a)(9) of the act, the alien is inadmissible for 10 years, or, in the case of an aggravated felon like these, for 20 years, so that--
--So that person is--
--But what I",0,0,8
993,"the point I'm trying to make is, in terms of his legal status he is in exactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the border, someone who has no rights--
--No, it does not,",0,0,8
994,but the important thing about,0,0,8
995,"the important thing to consider if you look at someone like Mezei, who was here for 25 years, and went abroad for I think 19 months before he came back in, the Court said that he was an arriving alien, even though he had a long time in this country,",2,3,8
996,"but the important point is that Mezei was about procedure, and what the Court was relying on in the so called entry fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown to the alien",2,2,8
997,"Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei rejected the notion that there was a substantive due process problem with detaining Mezei--
--And here--
--No",1,10,8
998,"and the other part of Mezei, that was the part of Mezei that depended on the entry fiction,",2,2,8
999,"but the other part of Mezei is, he had no liberty interest to be at large in the United States, and our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in the United States was extinguished by the final order of removal",2,2,8
1000,Absolutely,1,12,8
1001,"Absolutely--
--Not at all",0,0,8
1002,"I--
--That was exactly the point I was going to make",0,0,8
1003,"One could make the same point here with respect to the removal of an alien who was previously here, and whose right to remain here has been extinguished",1,8,8
1004,"The United States would not do this,",1,10,8
1005,"but one way to remove the alien from the United States would be to put him on a boat, or to insist that he find a county and, unless he finds a country he will be detained here",2,5,8
1006,"There's not a precedent, put this",1,8,8
1007,"put that way,",0,0,8
1008,"but if I may respond, the basis for the removal order in this case were criminal convictions, in which the aliens' criminal trials--
--But--
--No,",0,0,8
1009,but you said where the basis for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial,0,0,8
1010,"Here, there was a criminal trial",2,5,8
1011,"Well--
--Well, with all respect, the criminal conviction in this case, in both of these cases and in the great majority of cases in which people are being detained, plays a critical role in their continued detention",2,5,8
1012,This was something that the Court found to be a permissible factor in both Foucha and in,1,10,8
1013,"and particularly in Jones, where the Court said that there could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject to rebuttal by the individual, which is exactly what we have here",2,2,8
1014,Okay,1,12,8
1015,Okay,1,12,8
1016,Several,0,0,8
1017,"The first is Fong Yue Ting, which says--
--Fong, F o n g, Yue, I think it is, Y u e, Ting, T i n g, which says that Congress' power over",0,0,8
1018,"power to expel aliens, in other words to deport them, is the same and is as absolute as Congress' power to exclude aliens, and we've set out the relevant quote in our brief in the Zadvydas case, which I believe is at pages 37 and 38",1,10,8
1019,"So I think that is an important constitutional basis for the point I was making earlier, that once someone's right to remain here is extinguished, and he's put back in that status, it is proper to equate them to Mezei",1,10,8
1020,"The next line of cases that I would point to are cases, in particular, that",1,8,8
1021,"civil commitment cases, where the Court has, I think, contemplated that there could be subsequent determinations following on a presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of continuing dangerousness",2,5,8
1022,"No,",0,0,8
1023,"but it seems to me another important point that the Court has said with respect to aliens, and this, I can't remember the case in particular,",0,0,8
1024,"but the Court has said on a number of occasions that Congress can commit the determination of immigration matters to the executive branch, and have determinations made--
--Well, I--
--I believe that's correct",0,0,8
1025,"No,",0,0,8
1026,"but with respect to its fundamental point that the Congress--
--Precisely",0,0,8
1027,"That is exactly--
--That is--
--Right, and the point is that 1231(a)(6), enacted pursuant to Congress' plenary power, vests the release authority in the discretion of the Attorney General, and so it would be odd in that--
--There is habeas corpus review",0,0,8
1028,"We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held subject to the Attorney General's authority under the statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of the detention, so if there is an argument--
--Well, if there is constitutional review of the individualized determination, it would only be along the lines of what the Supreme",2,2,8
1029,"of what this Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores, which would be whether the Attorney General's determination was arbitrary",2,2,8
1030,That is correct,1,12,8
1031,"Right, and those--
--That is right, so",0,0,8
1032,"and the important point is for these purposes--
--We're certainly not saying there is no access to habeas corpus, to challenge the constitutionality of the detention",0,0,8
1033,"I think you are correct the alien will, under our submission, lose at least, or in the exceptional case, in that circumstance,",1,10,8
1034,but that's,0,0,8
1035,because Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate question of deciding when an alien should be released and not,1,10,8
1036,This,0,0,8
1037,"in this area, like in so many areas of immigration, this is intimately tied up with foreign relations",2,2,8
1038,"As we point in our briefs, with respect to Mr",0,0,8
1039,"Ma, for example, we are engaged in negotiations with Southeast Asian countries--
--We believe there is not, that under 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of title VIII it bars judicial review of anything, any determinations that are committed to the discretion of the Attorney General",2,2,8
1040,"Administrative process is good enough, and the first and basic point is the one that Justice Scalia said, which is that the most important ingredient of liberty interests at stake here was extinguished, the right to be at large in the United States was extinguished in the administrative deportation proceeding--
--subject to judicial review if the alien chose it, and the aliens in this case did not seek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty interests",1,10,8
1041,"I take it to be that there's no liberty interest, is my--
--But that I think cannot--
--That, I think, cannot be correct, at least if one looks at Wong Wing, which prohibited the service",0,0,8
1042,imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was in the United States,2,3,8
1043,"It is no part of our submission that an alien who is illegally present, or who has been paroled into the United States in a case like Mezei, is not a person for purposes of protection independent of the immigration laws,",2,5,8
1044,"but it's quite a different matter to say that the Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress' plenary power to protect the United States, and the safety of the United States",0,0,8
1045,"One other point that I'd like to make,",0,0,8
1046,"because it's important to bear in mind, protecting the safety of the citizens of the United States and the community is not ancillary to, or simply incidental to an immigration consequence",2,5,8
1047,"It is part of the whole point of removal of the aliens in this situation, that they were, as Justice Scalia pointed out, essentially in this country conditioned upon their compliance with our laws",1,8,8
1048,"They broke our laws, they committed crimes, and they",2,5,8
1049,and committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a danger to the community,2,5,8
1050,"Well, it is very likely to factor in to another country's calculus of how willing they will be to take someone back whether that person is in custody or not,",2,5,8
1051,because,0,0,8
1052,"the Court pointed out in Mezei that Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such as Mezei arrives at our borders, that person is no more our problem than the other country's",1,8,8
1053,"With respect to an alien and his own country of nationality, his liberty is that country's responsibility, not ours, rather than ours",2,5,8
1054,"That's--
--It goes beyond the excludable class,",0,0,8
1055,"because if a foreign dictator realized that he could cause the release into this country at large of nationals of that country simply by refusing to take people back--
--But that status has been extinguished, and they have no right to remain here, and they do have a right under international law to--
--Maybe not dumping in the first instance,",0,0,8
1056,but what the refusal to take someone back,0,0,8
1057,and we,0,0,8
1058,"for example, with respect to Cuba we have a number of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who we want to remove from our midst, not simply those who were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift, and if we have a foreign dictator--
--Well, it's we don't want them any more, and it is your responsibility to take him back, and the pressures on that other country, not simply from the United States Government",2,5,8
1059,"but from the alien himself, from human rights groups, from his family, are much greater for that other country to take him back when he's in detention",2,5,8
1060,"That's--
--That is correct, as we've seen--
--That is correct, as we're seeing--
--Pardon me?
Well, it depends on",0,0,8
1061,a lot of the aliens here are not released,2,2,8
1062,"I mean, they had previously to report--
--The Attorney General",2,2,8
1063,"first of all, questions such as this we think are committed to the discretion of the Attorney General",1,10,8
1064,"As we point out in our brief, the Attorney General in issuing the final regulations in December pointed out that INS had commissioned a study of other methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be released to see if there's some middle ground, halfway houses and things like that, and the notice points out that the INS is going to be expanding that program to see whether there are alternatives, but--
--No",0,0,8
1065,The aliens in this case are certainly not seeking house arrest,2,2,8
1066,"They are seeking being released under some degree of supervision,",2,2,8
1067,"but they are--
--Yes",0,0,8
1068,"We certainly think it would give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the person be released into a program, a halfway house or a drug treatment program, and that also is pointed out in the preamble to the new regulations,",1,10,8
1069,"but we don't believe--
--It could be,",0,0,8
1070,"but the questions of exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in, are mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney General under laws passed by Congress to administer the immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone should be kept in while they're being detained",1,10,8
1071,"I'm not sure of all of them,",0,0,8
1072,but there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving the jurisdiction,2,2,8
1073,"What the Attorney General has concluded is, for people who do not pose a threat to the community",1,10,8
1074,reporting requirements are not going to stop someone from being a threat to the community,1,10,8
1075,"They may guard against flight,",2,5,8
1076,but they are a far more inadequate protection against danger to the community,1,10,8
1077,"Yes,",0,0,8
1078,but the important,0,0,8
1079,"the balance of interest is completely different with respect to a citizen and an alien who not only--
--Because under Salerno, for example, the Court said that an individual's interest in liberty can be outweighed by important governmental interests",2,2,8
1080,"There is a compelling interest in protecting the safety of the community,",1,10,8
1081,"but where the liberty interest that is going to be--
--But the countervailing liberty interest is far, far less, to the extent the alien has any remaining liberty interest,",0,0,8
1082,because his right to be at large in the United States has been extinguished,2,5,8
1083,There is not,1,8,8
1084,"As we say, we're not challenging--
--Well, as we say, we're not challenging the ability for habeas corpus review",2,5,8
1085,"If that was an issue, the proper disposition would be to allow--
--Well, if there was going to be judicial review, it would be along the lines of Carlson, which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that power arbitrarily",2,2,8
1086,We think there probably might be a constitutional component to that to the extent the Court concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at all,1,10,8
1087,"That would be the proper way to address this, not to attack as a substantive due process matter, which is all that's here",1,10,8
1088,Yes,1,12,8
1089,"Under Carlson--
--Yes",0,0,8
1090,I think under Carlson there was review of those individualized custody determinations,1,10,8
1091,"No, that is absolutely correct,",1,12,8
1092,but the,0,0,8
1093,"again, coming back to the central issue in this case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory authority is reasonably related to the goals that have been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the detention is reasonably related, and that detention is subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney General every year, and in intervening periods the alien can request a review of his status by presenting changed material circumstances",1,10,8
1094,"In that situation, we think that is a very reasonable response on behalf of the two political branches about how to deal with the severe problem of dangerous criminal aliens in our midst",1,10,8
1095,"It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of every nation to protect itself against aliens who that nation does not believe should be in its presence for purposes of national sovereignty, national security,",2,2,8
1096,"but also the safety of the populace of that country, and that is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding to",2,3,8
1097,Safety is not simply a question to be addressed by the States,1,10,8
1098,"When it comes to aliens in this country, it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace of the United States against the presence of dangerous criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied due process, and the only remaining",2,2,8
1099,"in terms of giving Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the mentally ill",1,10,8
1100,"In that situation, it is directly parallel to the interests of a State",1,8,8
1101,"When does a State come in and intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an individual?
With respect to civil commitment, it is in the context of mental illness which gives the State a right to come in and look after the individual and protect the individual and the State",2,2,8
1102,"With respect to aliens, it is Congress' plenary power",1,8,8
1103,That has been satisfied,1,12,8
1104,"That has been permanently extinguished, that liberty interest",2,5,8
1105,"All that remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no longer dangerous at the end of a particular period",2,5,8
1106,"There have been no questions here about the statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the aliens,",2,2,8
1107,but we think it is clear that the Attorney General has that authority conferred by Congress,2,2,8

Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes",0,0,9
1109,"Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation",1,10,9
1110,No,1,12,9
1111,No,1,12,9
1112,"With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available",2,5,9
1113,"With respect to--
--Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and--
--it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that",0,0,9
1114,that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out,1,10,9
1115,So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause,1,10,9
1116,"Well, you have to look at the particular context",1,10,9
1117,"It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer",2,2,9
1118,If,0,0,9
1119,"if all--
--If",0,0,9
1120,"if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted",2,2,9
1121,"There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because--
--Under Blackhawk, it would be",2,2,9
1122,it would,1,9,9
1123,it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation,1,10,9
1124,because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be,2,2,9
1125,be directed in any particular manner,1,8,9
1126,"Now, there are some provisions in the--
--That",0,0,9
1127,that would include in the,1,10,9
1128,that would include the 2 percent,2,2,9
1129,"But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services",2,2,9
1130,"So you'd have to take into account--
--those particular provisos",0,0,9
1131,"Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute",2,2,9
1132,If you look at page 15a of the appendix to,0,0,9
1133,"to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause",2,5,9
1134,"You have to look at the particular context in which this statute--
--It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect",0,0,9
1135,"It says, notwithstanding any other provision",1,10,9
1136,and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a,0,0,9
1137,the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and,1,10,9
1138,"and this is--
--That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical",0,0,9
1139,But the term available,2,2,9
1140,and I think this is critical,0,0,9
1141,"The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence",2,2,9
1142,I,0,0,9
1143,I think that argument is incorrect,1,10,9
1144,"First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause",1,10,9
1145,"But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to",2,5,9
1146,to the terms of the ISDA itself,2,2,9
1147,And if you'll look at page 12a,0,0,9
1148,and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1),0,0,9
1149,"what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided",2,2,9
1150,"And then later on down in the paragraph--
--I'm sorry",0,0,9
1151,"It's--
--Shall not",0,0,9
1152,shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided,2,3,9
1153,And then further down in the paragraph in the last,0,0,9
1154,"in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable",2,2,9
1155,"And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide",1,10,9
1156,And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes,2,2,9
1157,because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency,2,5,9
1158,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy",1,12,9
1159,I think it's more of a characterization disagreement,1,8,9
1160,There,0,0,9
1161,"it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring,",1,10,9
1162,"but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be",0,0,9
1163,to be turned over,1,10,9
1164,Correct,2,3,9
1165,"Well, it's talking about both",2,5,9
1166,because the,0,0,9
1167,the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds,2,2,9
1168,"It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i",0,0,9
1169,e,0,0,9
1170,", those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes",2,2,9
1171,And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions,1,10,9
1172,"Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading",2,2,9
1173,the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section,2,2,9
1174,And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with,1,10,9
1175,And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top,2,2,9
1176,"Oh, absolutely there are",2,5,9
1177,The Federal functions is the broader set of,1,10,9
1178,it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does,1,8,9
1179,Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform,1,10,9
1180,"And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions",2,2,9
1181,It,0,0,9
1182,it does,1,12,9
1183,"It does, Justice Scalia",2,2,9
1184,Justice Souter,1,12,9
1185,Excuse me,0,0,9
1186,And we describe the,0,0,9
1187,"the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31",0,0,9
1188,When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA,2,2,9
1189,and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance,0,0,9
1190,"There's a provision there, 25 U",2,2,9
1191,S,0,0,9
1192,C,0,0,9
1193,458cc(k),0,0,9
1194,And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal,2,2,9
1195,And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes,1,10,9
1196,"Justice Breyer, one background principle",2,5,9
1197,"and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves",0,0,9
1198,One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes,1,10,9
1199,"And the contracts--
--No",0,0,9
1200,"They specifically--
--They specifically did not transfer--
--No",2,2,9
1201,The,0,0,9
1202,"that's correct, Justice O'Connor",0,0,9
1203,"What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs--
--Correct",2,5,9
1204,Correct,2,3,9
1205,It relates to the funds that are available,1,10,9
1206,"And the tribes' position--
--Right",2,2,9
1207,"Not funds--
--Right",2,2,9
1208,We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off,2,3,9
1209,"off the--
--Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense",0,0,9
1210,It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year,2,2,9
1211,In,0,0,9
1212,in part it was mandated by the statute,2,2,9
1213,"Perhaps not in whole--
--but at least in significant part",2,5,9
1214,And let me,0,0,9
1215,"but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated",0,0,9
1216,"The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built",1,10,9
1217,And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief,1,10,9
1218,"There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations",2,2,9
1219,But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years,1,10,9
1220,There was always an increase,1,8,9
1221,"And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year",2,5,9
1222,"Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two",2,2,9
1223,two considerations on top,1,12,9
1224,The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments,2,2,9
1225,"And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute",1,10,9
1226,And that,0,0,9
1227,"I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U",0,0,9
1228,S,0,0,9
1229,C,0,0,9
1230,1680a,0,0,9
1231,It was,1,12,9
1232,I,0,0,9
1233,I think in principal part it was mandated by the,1,9,9

--Well, let--
--At least as far--
--insofar as what I've said with respect--
--Sorry",0,0,9
1235,"No, Justice Stevens",2,3,9
1236,"No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that",1,10,9
1237,And that's what I'm trying to explain,0,0,9
1238,"At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the",2,5,9
1239,that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done,1,10,9
1240,"With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U",2,2,9
1241,S,0,0,9
1242,C,0,0,9
1243,"1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly",2,2,9
1244,"In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes",1,10,9
1245,"And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year",2,2,9
1246,"And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks",1,10,9
1247,"For example, in this particular case, the",0,0,9
1248,one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma,2,2,9
1249,That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the,2,2,9
1250,for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement,2,2,9
1251,"Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in",2,5,9
1252,in Congress' appropriation committee reports,2,2,9
1253,"And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored",2,5,9
1254,"They're not binding law, Justice Stevens",2,2,9
1255,We fully recognize that,1,8,9
1256,"But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports",1,9,9
1257,"It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter",2,2,9
1258,It's the reduction clause,1,10,9
1259,The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract,2,2,9
1260,"That is what they're saying, Justice Souter,",0,0,9
1261,"but with respect to, I think it's incorrect",1,8,9
1262,The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy,1,10,9
1263,There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions,2,2,9
1264,And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions,1,10,9
1265,"Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA",2,5,9
1266,"because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter",2,2,9
1267,No,1,12,9
1268,They thought,1,8,9
1269,the,0,0,9
1270,the board,2,2,9
1271,"the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought--
--Well, I don't think the Board of",2,2,9
1272,of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from,2,5,9
1273,They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient,2,5,9
1274,"Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available",2,2,9
1275,And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said,1,9,9
1276,I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with,1,10,9
1277,"But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function--
--Well, let's",2,2,9
1278,"Justice Souter, if I",0,0,9
1279,"if I could, let's look at the particular sources--
--Well, I",0,0,9
1280,"I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the",1,10,9
1281,"the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe",2,2,9
1282,"With respect to the administrative support--
--I don't",2,5,9
1283,"I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg",2,3,9
1284,"I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case",1,10,9
1285,And there's,0,0,9
1286,there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for,2,2,9
1287,"to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe",1,10,9
1288,"So--
--We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's",2,5,9
1289,it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes,1,10,9
1290,"And again, one of the new facilities--
--Because--
--Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline",1,10,9
1291,We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases,1,10,9
1292,And one way to see that is 25 U,0,0,9
1293,S,0,0,9
1294,C,0,0,9
1295,"1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs",2,2,9
1296,And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year,1,10,9
1297,"So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount",1,10,9
1298,"Well, they",0,0,9
1299,"they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example",1,8,9
1300,I think the one example that they give,1,8,9
1301,and maybe there are more,0,0,9
1302,is,0,0,9
1303,is a diabetes program,1,10,9
1304,"But I think it's more the general principle--
--That's an",1,10,9
1305,the,0,0,9
1306,the particular example is an existing program,2,5,9
1307,"But I think it's more--
--You're",2,5,9
1308,"you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs",1,10,9
1309,"If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's",2,5,9
1310,that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997,2,2,9
1311,It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions,2,2,9
1312,"And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs",2,5,9
1313,"Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998",2,2,9
1314,It had done so,2,2,9
1315,since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS,2,2,9
1316,I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall,1,8,9
1317,My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond,1,10,9
1318,And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two,1,8,9
1319,"But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act",2,2,9
1320,"And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list",1,8,9
1321,at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA,2,5,9
1322,"And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997",2,2,9
1323,"So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA",2,5,9
1324,"I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available",2,2,9
1325,And that would have significant consequences,2,5,9
1326,"because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts,",2,2,9
1327,but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts,2,2,9
1328,"And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to",1,10,9
1329,to divert the entire amount of administrative support for,2,5,9
1330,"for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years",2,5,9

1351,"but they can make you answer, Your Honor",0,0,11
1352,"And, that is what is important",0,0,11
1353,There are things you may not want to answer,1,10,11
1354,True,1,12,11
1355,"But my point is, protection from the Fourth and Fifth are extremely limited here more than anywhere else in this subpoena power without an attorney and without telling you what the relevancy is or telling you what they are investigating",1,10,11
1356,I just want you to be in focus here very precisely the exact power we are talking about,1,8,11
1357,"And, now, to use it for civil?
That is the question we are talking about in this case",2,5,11
1358,"Now, I am going to go to my argument",1,9,11
1359,That is a totally false argument that they raise,1,10,11
1360,"I am not disputing that, Your Honor",1,9,11
1361,"But, the issue they raise is a totally false one",1,10,11
1362,"The issue is not, why are you interfering with the organization of our Department",1,10,11
1363,That is not the issue,1,10,11
1364,The issue is can any one attorney in the Department of Justice or U,2,2,11
1365,S,0,0,11
1366,Attorney use these materials for civil purposes without a court order in advance,2,5,11
1367,"That is the issue, not whether it is a Civil Division, the Tax Division, the Anti-Trust Division or the Criminal",2,2,11
1368,"well the Criminal, of course",2,5,11
1369,"But, any attorney for civil purposes without first getting a court order",2,5,11
1370,"That is the issue here, not the organization",1,10,11
1371,The government has asked you to visit with them in a place that I call procedural ivory tower,2,5,11
1372,I would like you now to go on a tour with Respondents and the illustrious amici in this country that have filed in this case,2,2,11
1373,A tour that took you in the briefs very quickly through the contemporary constitutional grand jury and explored what is actually going on and the abuses that are actually occurring,2,2,11
1374,I am not going to belabor that here,1,10,11
1375,"The briefs are resplendent with it and not just ours, four others from across the country",2,2,11
1376,I would like you today to visit with me to another place one that Justice Brennan has some personal knowledge of,2,5,11
1377,"That is the case 25 years ago called Proctor and Gamble, a case that the government relies on very heavily",2,2,11
1378,"Now, I want to bring you forward from there to this case",1,10,11
1379,I want to show you that this case is the third leg of an executive triad which the net result is to vest the total custody of the grand jury in the executive,1,10,11
1380,"And, I want to explore with you why that will happen in this case",0,0,11
1381,"First, why are we leaving the procedural ivory tower?
Because this case and Baggot that follows poses three questions to you which the government has classified as procedural, which the government has said we should decide based upon legislative intent, which we will explore, too, which the government wants you to decide in the ivory tower",0,0,11
1382,"Respondents and amici say that these three questions pose a far more fundamental question, a far more substantive question, whether the grand jury subpoena should be used as an ex parte, dual purpose discovery tool by the executive to conduct civil as well as criminal investigations",2,2,11
1383,I am talking about that power I just described,1,9,11
1384,Yes,1,12,11
1385,"I want you to decide it on a constitutional ground and grounds, Your Honor",1,10,11
1386,"And I--
--Yes it is, and I will get to that",0,0,11
1387,We have here twin levels of concern,2,5,11
1388,The first is in this case,1,8,11
1389,The second is this case and Baggot,1,8,11
1390,"In this case, they are asking you to give them automatic access without court supervision under 6(e)(3)(A)(i)",2,5,11
1391,"without court supervision, number one",2,5,11
1392,"Number two, they are asking you to apply a rationally related test, they say, to support personnel that they would not otherwise classify as untechnical like secretaries and so forth",2,2,11
1393,The issues are broader than that,1,10,11
1394,"Once you make that ruling were you to deem it, you have just decided to test the entire government for practical purposes were actually related, relevancy--
--Your Honor, I suppose, as a practical matter, that might happen",0,0,11
1395,I do not think it should,1,11,11
1396,I suppose so,0,0,11
1397,"But I am not, really not focusing on the Criminal Division",1,8,11
1398,"because there is a certain amount of practicality, I have to concede, that is involved in the Criminal Division",1,10,11
1399,"But, I would say that that should be done with utmost care for the very reasons the government argued in Proctor and Gamble, which I will give to you",0,0,11
1400,the utmost care,1,10,11
1401,"Now, why are we concerned in this case with the government getting automatically without court supervision or approval or were actually related no test at all?
Because--
--They have it as a criminal--
--As a criminal custodian in a temporary way as an assistant to the grand jury",2,5,11
1402,"Whittaker said in Proctor and Gamble,
""This is not the property of the Justice Department or the U",2,2,11
1403,S,0,0,11
1404,Attorney,1,12,11
1405,"""
""It is the property of the court and the grand jury",2,2,11
1406,"""
Now that was a concurring opinion,",0,0,11
1407,but he was the only one who said anything about it in that decision,0,0,11
1408,"The prosecutor has that, Your Honor, wearing his criminal hat",2,5,11
1409,"But he is wearing a criminal hat, and that is the point",2,5,11
1410,"Your Honor, we are talking about--
--Pardon?
That is true",2,5,11
1411,"And, I cannot unring the bell",0,0,11
1412,That is very true,1,12,11
1413,"But the point is, how can he use it thereafter for civil purposes",1,10,11
1414,You have to go back and see how he got it for criminal purposes and why he got it for criminal purposes before you decide he should be able to go on and use it for anything else,2,5,11
1415,"That is a very clear line that must be drawn, and that is the line I want to be sure that you understand needs to be drawn, Your Honor",0,0,11
1416,"Let me go back, if I might, to our concerns with regard to the civil side of this",1,10,11
1417,"The attorney for the government can concurrently develop a civil case and has been doing so, which I will demonstrate, as Justice Brennan may well recall in Proctor & Gamble was an issue there",2,5,11
1418,He can marshal evidence for a civil case if he has to answer to nobody with regard to the use of that evidence and automatically apply it,2,3,11
1419,"Yes, I am saying it is wrong",1,10,11
1420,The question was raised in a sense in Proctor & Gamble,1,10,11
1421,"And, I will answer it this way",0,0,11
1422,The Court ducked the issue and the buck stops here,2,5,11
1423,You now have that issue before you,1,10,11
1424,"It has not been before this Court until now--
--Of course, the allegations in that case were they never brought it for criminal in the first place, or if they did--
--My position is that they should not be able to use the grand jury for civil purposes, and I must say that Proctor & Gamble does raise",0,0,11
1425,I am going to give you a little gimme here,1,10,11
1426,"Proctor & Gamble does raise and Anti-Trust raises a little different level,",2,2,11
1427,because Anti-Trust is not the traditional civil situation,2,5,11
1428,"When you are talking about the Sherman Act, you are talking about a twin level of enforcement",1,10,11
1429,One is injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining a wrong that is going on in a civil arena,2,2,11
1430,"That is one that I do have to say falls in this quasi-criminal category, perhaps",1,10,11
1431,But that is not the collection of money,2,2,11
1432,"I think we are talking here about the collection of money, and I think a fraud claim is less than",1,10,11
1433,for this reason,0,0,11
1434,"Because injunctive relief is a civil remedy, it is not a criminal remedy",2,5,11
1435,And,0,0,11
1436,"because the way the courts and the law are structure in the common law system, you do it in the civil arena",1,10,11
1437,But it is really a criminal concept,1,10,11
1438,"It is really saying, do not do that",1,11,11
1439,That is wrong,1,10,11
1440,"That is against the law, and we are going to enjoin you from ever doing that any more",1,10,11
1441,"But, they do it in the civil arena",2,5,11
1442,"That is the only gimme I will give you on that, Your Honor",2,2,11
1443,"You mean versus the double damages?
No, they can get double damages",0,0,11
1444,In a civil courts claims action,2,2,11
1445,All right,1,12,11
1446,"Yes,",0,0,11
1447,because we are talking about compensating somebody to make him whole,2,2,11
1448,That is what we are talking about there,2,2,11
1449,That is different than from restraining and from doing an ongoing wrong,1,9,11
1450,There is a clear distinction between those two,1,10,11
1451,"Well, I am not trying to apply it to my case other than the fact--
--Well, Your Honor, the give me that I made was an injunction aspect of it to prevent an ongoing wrong which was criminal itself",0,0,11
1452,That is the only give me I made,1,10,11
1453,"Are you talking about Proctor & Gamble?
Well, if you prosecute criminals you are going to send somebody to jail or impose a fine, one of the two, or a cease and desist order which gets into the quasi area",2,5,11
1454,"But, if you are going to go for injunctive relief, you are forcing them to stop doing what they are doing in a sense",1,8,11
1455,"Look, you asked in a hearing the other day, where is the bright line",2,5,11
1456,"That is not the bright line, Your Honor",1,8,11
1457,We are in a gray area there,2,5,11
1458,"That is not the bright line, and I cannot give you all of the answers absolutely, and I do not think you can decide them absolutely there either without a give and take situation",1,10,11
1459,The second level of concern we have is combining Baggot and this case,1,8,11
1460,In Baggot they are saying the IRS is doing this preliminary to the judicial proceeding when they are doing a tax investigation,2,2,11
1461,That is the case you are going to hear argued next,1,10,11
1462,"How you decide that, coupled with the rationally related aspect of their question here",2,5,11
1463,"If you decide rationally related is fine and administrative proceedings are preliminary to judicial proceedings, and, therefore, they get it under 6(e)(3)(C)(i), then we have an administrative agency in there using the grand jury, this forthwith subpoena power, the power of the absolute monarch to collect taxes",2,2,11
1464,"Is that what we want?
Are we going to use that kind of a power to collect taxes?
Now, we really have here an issue of the ex parte power dual use of the grand jury",0,0,11
1465,This issue is squarely joined in our briefs,1,10,11
1466,"It is squarely joined, whether you know it or not",2,2,11
1467,"They have cited Proctor & Gamble, which was a dual use case that I want to talk about",2,3,11
1468,"And, in the Baggot brief at page 12 of the summary of their argument, read it",2,5,11
1469,"You know what they tell you?
The government states there that it has been a very effective way for agencies to perform its dual enforcement programs",2,5,11
1470,"They say there that the agency assistance must be bought, bought by delivering up the fruits of the investigation",2,2,11
1471,They say there that if you do not do that the IRS will threaten to stop providing that assistance,2,5,11
1472,"Do you know what they say there?
They say there that the 6(e) amendment in 1977 which Congress said very clearly should not be used for civil purposes, they say wipe it out",2,2,11
1473,That is what they say there,2,2,11
1474,That issue is joined,1,10,11
1475,Let me talk about this triad that I mentioned,2,2,11
1476,The first leg is Proctor & Gamble,2,2,11
1477,Proctor & Gamble is important to the government for the purposes of the triad,2,2,11
1478,"because the government says that Proctor & Gamble said that private parties are the only ones that have to show particularized and compelling need, while the government hides behind it and uses it for civil purposes any and every way it desires",2,2,11
1479,That is the first leg of the triad,2,2,11
1480,They also say that Proctor & Gamble stands for the proposition that automatic access has been approved by this Court,2,2,11
1481,Nonsense,1,8,11
1482,And I want to take you through that,1,10,11
1483,"But, first, on this triad, what is it?
It is Proctor & Gamble",0,0,11
1484,"It is a 1977 6(e) amendment, and it is Sells and Baggot if you grant them what they want, they have full and complete and total executive control of the grand jury",2,2,11
1485,The active agency participation was decided,2,2,11
1486,it may not be constitutional,1,10,11
1487,but it was decided in the 1977 amendment of 6(e) that any agency personnel for any reason can be brought in without a court order and without court supervision,2,3,11
1488,"Secondly, the dual purpose subpoena power, that is the issue here",1,10,11
1489,"Third, easy, wholesale access to all of it, that is at issue here",2,5,11
1490,"Fourth, civil administrative proceedings being preliminary, too, that is an issue in Baggot",2,2,11
1491,"Restricted private party access, but, of course, just private party access under particularized and compelling, that was in Proctor & Gamble, so the government says",0,0,11
1492,"And, of course, they proceed to use it in cases like Saconni Vacuum and so forth as they desire with a very limited and restrictive capability of defending against it as far as the other side is concerned,",2,5,11
1493,"because they hover and hold it all here and let it be looked at in camera, et cetera while they use it to refresh witnesses and witnesses, by the way, which without attorney being present were asked leading questions who framed their answers in that context and then became married to them, not in the adversary proceeding",2,2,11
1494,And then they are stuck with them later for they are inconsistent and their credibility is gone,2,5,11
1495,What we have got here is the camel's head went under the tent when the prosecutor came into the grand jury,2,2,11
1496,"In the 1977 6(e) amendment, the whole camel went in",2,2,11
1497,"The government says, we are watching the chicken coop, the fox, and we will let you know if we are going to let you have materials or not, and we will eat them whenever we want",2,2,11
1498,"And, besides that, the government says we the executive, we monitor the grand jury and we run the show and we are the tail wagging the dog",2,5,11
1499,That is what the government says,1,10,11
1500,Proctor & Gamble is the first leg of this triad,2,2,11
1501,It held that civil use was okay,1,10,11
1502,It held that particularized and compelling need must be applied to grand jury materials,1,10,11
1503,because of the necessity of retaining the secrecy doctrine that came into the Constitution with it,2,5,11
1504,"What was the real focus in Proctor & Gamble?
The certified question was very narrow, whether good cause requires Rule 34 production by government for grand jury testimony",2,2,11
1505,Very narrow,1,11,11
1506,There were prior motions two years ago,2,2,11
1507,"before, I should say",0,0,11
1508,"two years before, where Proctor & Gamble tried to suppress and tried to get returned and argued that it was wrong for them to have it and all of that",2,3,11
1509,"They were denied by Judge Moradelli who thought, gee, government cannot be wrong",2,2,11
1510,denied by Moradelli,2,2,11
1511,Two years later he was accusing the government of having a plan,2,3,11
1512,"That is in Volume 50, Case 51 of the 1957-58 up in the library",2,3,11
1513,Look at Moradelli's decision in the case below,2,2,11
1514,It came straight up to this Court under the Expediting Act,2,2,11
1515,"Now, look at the brief of American Association of Soap Manufacturers",2,5,11
1516,It tells you precisely the dual purpose that was going on down there in that case,1,8,11
1517,There were alot of other issues that the majority ducked,2,5,11
1518,"because it could not reach agreement, I suggest",0,0,11
1519,Perhaps Justice Brennan can tell you better,1,10,11
1520,"But, there were three dissents",2,5,11
1521,"Harlan, Burton, and Frankfurter said, hey, why are we disturbing that sound discretion",2,5,11
1522,Look at this one-reason opinion of the trial court,2,5,11
1523,"Besides that, the government is a recalcitrant party, and they will not cooperate",2,2,11
1524,Why are we disturbing that,0,0,11
1525,"Whittaker said, hey, there is civil discovery that is going on here, and that is not right",2,5,11
1526,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,11
1527,"Am I making a mistake?
Well, I am saying Justice Whittaker, and I--
--I am sorry",0,0,11
1528,I thought I was saying that,1,9,11
1529,Justice Whittaker said that civil discovery use should be limited for both sides,1,10,11
1530,It was not discussed by the majority at all,1,10,11
1531,Justice Whittaker said that possession and property is not that of the Justice Department,2,3,11
1532,It is in the court,2,2,11
1533,Justice Whittaker said that equal discovery treatment should be applied,1,10,11
1534,The thing that was not discussed by anybody was under what process of procedure should the government be able to get this material,2,2,11
1535,"But, what process of procedure should the attorney for the government be using it",2,5,11
1536,That was not the issue here,1,10,11
1537,"because that was the issue two years earlier, and it did not come up on appeal",2,5,11
1538,It just wasn't,1,8,11
1539,"And, this Court had a hard time coming to grips with the one thing they did decide or two",2,5,11
1540,Look at the major issues they did not want to try to wrestle with or could not wrestle with at the time,2,2,11
1541,It was a strongly divided Court,1,10,11
1542,It was clearly a dual purpose grand jury case situation,1,10,11
1543,"It was the first leg of the triad because, as far as the government is concerned, it said nobody else out there can have this material",2,2,11
1544,but us except on a particularized and compelling need,0,0,11
1545,"Now, the government argued that",1,10,11
1546,because they argued the Rose five reasons for grand jury secrecy,2,2,11
1547,The Rose five reasons they argued emphasized the fourth,1,8,11
1548,The fourth reason being for witness protection and with the emphasis on,1,8,11
1549,because future grand juries will be ineffective unless we preserve the secrecy of this material,2,5,11
1550,"Now, I do not think there is any question that that stood for the proposition of secrecy and it applied to all concerned,",1,10,11
1551,but that is not how the government has been applying it,0,0,11
1552,"Now, the government was in a role reversal situation",1,10,11
1553,They were the ones that argued secrecy,2,5,11
1554,"They were the ones urging Rose 4, and they were the ones talking about the future of the grand jury",2,3,11
1555,They were the ones that suggested the words compelling necessity,1,8,11
1556,Look at their brief,2,2,11
1557,"Now, let's talk about the 1977 Rule 6(e), if I can for a moment",0,0,11
1558,This is the second leg of the triad,2,2,11
1559,"They urged that Congress ratify their continuing automatic access which nobody ever gave them in the first place, subselliantial",2,5,11
1560,Nobody ever gave it to them in the first place,2,5,11
1561,They say that the 1977 amendments that the Congress ratified it,2,2,11
1562,They say so,0,0,11
1563,because of lack of parallel construction between (A)(1) and (A) double toothpicks,2,2,11
1564,That is how they argue it,1,10,11
1565,"First, the only and single issue addressed in the 1977 hearing",2,2,11
1566,1976 hearings on 1977,2,3,11
1567,was whether or not there should be technical personnel,1,10,11
1568,There was a colloquy between Professor Wayne LeFave and Congresswoman Holsmith that is very telling,2,2,11
1569,It was under the original draft of the Advisory Committee with regard to,1,10,11
1570,"including under the term, attorneys for the government",2,2,11
1571,technical personnel as they deem necessary all in the performance of the attorney's duties,2,5,11
1572,"And she says, isn't there a possibility that, for example, an IRS agent will be confused about what the duties are, and he will think it is duty to do civil work?
And, Professor Wayne LeFave said,
""That is a legitimate concern",0,0,11
1573,"""
""Maybe the language ought to be changed to make this clearer than it is",1,10,11
1574,"""
And that is exactly what they did",2,2,11
1575,"The other thing that is important is Richard Thornberg, acting Deputy Attorney General, gave testimony to that Committee",2,2,11
1576,and I am addressing these two witnesses,0,0,11
1577,because I think their testimony is critical,2,5,11
1578,"Thornberg told the Committee, giving two examples, it would be our policy to always get a 6(e) order",1,10,11
1579,"And, the clearest example I can give you is if there is a civil fraud action and we cannot make the case criminally, and we have to go after it civilly, we will come in and get a 6(e) order",0,0,11
1580,"Then, he contrasted that, of course, the prototype here is the IRS with the agency involved and we would also have to get a 6(e) order for the agency",1,10,11
1581,"I submit to you that is the Sells case, civil fraud and IRS, Sells I and Sells II",2,3,11
1582,That is what is involved,1,10,11
1583,"And, the issue here is should they get a 6(e) order",1,10,11
1584,Look at that testimony,2,5,11
1585,It is very telling in that respect,1,12,11
1586,"Now, I would like to talk briefly just about duty",2,5,11
1587,Duty is a limiting word,1,8,11
1588,"It is duty in the criminal context of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 6(e), which was designed purely for a criminal function",2,2,11
1589,"We are talking here about the client, the function, and the duty of the Department of Justice which is all over the place",2,5,11
1590,"Duty is anything from HUD, EPA, special assistant to the grand jury to civil fraud to Tax Division to anti-trust",2,3,11
1591,It is every duty you can imagine a lawyer performs,1,10,11
1592,"So, we are talking about the client, function, and duty, not titles",2,5,11
1593,Isn't the duty of an agency attorney equally as important in the collection of taxes or SEC or otherwise as the duty of the Justice Department when he is doing the same thing,2,2,11
1594,It is not titles that is involved,1,8,11
1595,"It is duty, client, and function",1,8,11
1596,"I have already addressed what I believe to be a fake issue, so I will leave that one alone",2,3,11
1597,Let me talk briefly about attorney abuse,2,5,11
1598,"Attorney abuse is claimed here, not just IRS abuse",2,2,11
1599,"If you go to the Statement, Part B of our red brief, you will see there that none of that could have happened without the active participation and assistance of the U",2,3,11
1600,S,0,0,11
1601,Attorney's office,2,2,11
1602,Subpoenas were issued,2,2,11
1603,Every witness virtually was diverted to an intelligent IRS agent for examination and interrogation,2,5,11
1604,"In one situation where the record on the affidavits and transcript in these proceedings, the record demonstrates that the AUSA participated in diversion of a witness to the IRS agent when there was not really a grand jury panel that was ever going to hear it any way,",2,5,11
1605,"because he says himself the first time we intended to schedule anything was March, and this was going on in January, and the old panel had terminated",2,3,11
1606,That is in Part B of the Statement,1,10,11
1607,They accuse us of a blunderbuss assault,2,5,11
1608,"Yes, do you know what a blunderbuss is?
A large bore, an old-fashioned weapon with a big muzzle when loaded with a lot of ball is very effective at close range",2,5,11
1609,"I accept that definition, and those balls all hit their mark, and they will not touch them with a ten foot pole",2,2,11
1610,because that statement is documented to affidavits of the government and transcript 99 percent,2,5,11
1611,"The sixth reason for secrecy, very important here",2,2,11
1612,One more to add to Rose,1,10,11
1613,"It was said by Justice Whittaker, to eliminate the temptation to conduct grand jury investigations as a means of ex parte procurement of direct or derivative evidence for use in a contemplated civil suit",2,2,11
1614,"Add it to the other five,",0,0,11
1615,because there is a ground swell out there that is begging you to add it,2,2,11
1616,"The lower courts, many of them have come down with that",2,2,11
1617,The Seventh and the Ninth in Baggot and here,2,2,11
1618,"excuse me, Miller, Baggot in the Seventh",2,3,11
1619,and the Ninth here have said it,0,0,11
1620,"And, there are many courts and legal commentators that have said it",2,2,11
1621,Add it,1,10,11
1622,"The grand jury is still here?
Yes",0,0,11
1623,I am simply saying add it to one of the standards to be looked at for the purpose of protection of secrecy doctrine,1,10,11
1624,Secrecy has a constitutional dimension,1,10,11
1625,"This Court said in 1943 in Johnson, it is indispensable",2,2,11
1626,"In 1956 in Costello,
""A body of laymen acting in secret",2,2,11
1627,"""
In 1959 in Pittsburgh
""Secrecy is part of the modus operandi of the grand jury",2,2,11
1628,"""
In 1979,
""It's proper functioning depends upon it",1,8,11
1629,"""
It went into the Bill of Rights as a citizen protection",2,2,11
1630,It was utterly dependent upon secrecy,2,5,11
1631,"because before secrecy it was absolute power of the monarch--
--Thank you very much, Your Honor",2,5,11
1632,Mr,0,0,12
1633,Chief Justice and may I please the Court,2,3,12
1634,"Now, this doesn't involve the simple case of publication of the case history that is being enjoined",1,10,12
1635,What we have in this case is a patient's confidences divulge to her psychiatrist copied almost verbatim,2,5,12
1636,"Notes made during each psychiatric session between the psychiatrist and her patient, who is the respondent in this case, and the patient's husband, and those notes written at lenght after the sessions and then made into a book and as I understand from the brief of the amicus in this case, the American Psychiatric Associations",2,2,12
1637,"In these sessions, a patient is encouraged to dredge up from the unconscious thoughts that would never be expressed",2,2,12
1638,"Memories that had been too distressing to keep in mind and the like, and all these were written down, where a vote by the psychiatrist questions, were then written down and then publish and they relate to such matters as the patient's thoughts during intercourse, her husband's masturbation, her own masturbation, her fantasies about incest, then the like, all these then published in a book and retailed in and discount houses, department stores, trade bookstores even music stores",2,2,12
1639,This is the kind of book and this is the problem that we have here today and this is again just not a case history,2,2,12
1640,"I can't imagine the situation in which there has been a greater assault on a persons dignity, on a person's self respect to have these thoughts said out for one's neighbors, for one's children, for one's students to read",2,2,12
1641,because patient here is an assistant professor in the university,2,5,12
1642,"She is herself a psychotherapist, one can't imagine what would happen if this got into the hands of her pupils or her own patients or her own children or her own friends",2,5,12
1643,"I don't know your Honor, I think as the statement made by the psychiatrist here and we have no --
Pardon me",2,3,12
1644,"Oh, it's a statement made which we haven't verified as yet, and I'm going to come to this question of the status of the case and why we are so little advance and why a year and half had past",0,0,12
1645,since the preliminary injunction was granted,2,5,12
1646,"Now, the first preliminary injunction on this case was an injunction which prevented the sale only in the trade stores and the department stores, and in the discount houses put a large sale, in medical schools, in libraries who dealt with scientific books and the like, and as soon as that injunction was issue the limited injunction was issued we representing the patient wrote a letter to the Court saying we would like an immediate trial and we suggest that the Court allow ten days for pretrial examination, pretrial discovery before the full trial starts and we receive no response, that letter is that A91 of the record",2,5,12
1647,"We received no response, the order or the injunction, the limited injunction was slightly modified and the case was assigned to a judge for all purposes including trial and we wrote that judge and we said, “May we have an immediate trial?”
And the attorney for the psychiatrist wrote back and said, “We don't join in that application, as a matter of fact we probably we'll appeal,” and this is a very complicated case and we want our learned pretrial examinations",0,0,12
1648,"Now of course, the appeals were taken, so that it wouldn't been difficult to have at trial, and New York state could have been secured without any difficulty I think your Honor, Mr",2,5,12
1649,"Justice Stewart asked that question before and a state would be issued on appeal, the state of the trial of the question of the right to injunction were challenged",2,3,12
1650,"Well, retain jurisdiction of the case you Honor",2,5,12
1651,I think it would have been necessary to apply to the Appellate Court for stay,1,10,12
1652,but those stays are automatically granted,2,2,12
1653,"As indeed, they should be if there is a real question to be determined",1,8,12
1654,"But now, coming back to this procedure here as I said when the case was assigned to a judge for trial and for all other purposes we again ask for the immediate trial and we again had the opposition of the psychiatrist here",2,5,12
1655,"And they said they had a law in pretrial examination and indeed, it occupied a longer period of time",2,5,12
1656,"because of his completed only last week, exactly one week ago",2,2,12
1657,"And we got it completed only by applying to the Court to compel that completion of the examination,",2,5,12
1658,"but only the parts of six days and now according from the psychiatrist's brief, the reply brief only the parts of six days were taken over this year and half, that examination before trial",2,2,12
1659,"So that any delay or duration of this preliminary injunction is entirely the fault of the psychiatrist here and indeed, over the opposition of the patient, who wanted a quick trial on disposition of this case",2,5,12
1660,"Now, Mr",0,0,12
1661,Karpatkin stated an answer to a question of Mr,1,10,12
1662,"Justice Stewart that if there were identification of the patient in this book, an injunction could issue at the trial",2,5,12
1663,And I think that virtually dispossess of the case,2,2,12
1664,"May I first tell you factually what the identification in the book is, the book does give fictitious names to the parties and says they are fictitious",2,2,12
1665,But then goes on to give a great many details of the lives of these people indicates that the patient's husband was a professional speech writer,2,2,12
1666,I wanted to show that there's a factor of base for identification,1,8,12
1667,because Mr,0,0,12
1668,"Karpatkin and says if there is identification, then there is an end to the matter",2,2,12
1669,Mr,0,0,12
1670,"Karpatkin failed to indicate that that was modified by the appellate division, and it's no longer a holding that --
No, it what it says that the claim justification for publication, the attempt to disguise her identity does not provides sufficiently valid --
I think so",0,0,12
1671,but I think we can go great deal further your Honor and say that it is a matter of law,0,0,12
1672,Certainly not,2,5,12
1673,"May I --
May I say your Honor that as I understand the law you should not and may I expand on that for just a moment of does your Honor have some other question?
Well, I still think we have a cause action your Honor",0,0,12
1674,"I think we have a cause of action base --
Yes, Your Honor",2,2,12
1675,There was unquestionably of violation of statute and that Mr,2,5,12
1676,"Justice Stewart pointed out, I mean implied contract between the parties",1,10,12
1677,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,12
1678,I think New York could on two basis,1,8,12
1679,One basis is there has been a violation of statute given rise to a cause of action without identification,1,10,12
1680,The law is very clear and says the doctor may not disclose,2,5,12
1681,It doesn't say and identify in the cause of disclosure,2,2,12
1682,"No, no, no, I don't think so your Honor, I think that the cause of action exist and I think that the cause of the action exist just by the publication",2,5,12
1683,because the patient has been injured by that publication,2,5,12
1684,"Again, the answer I believe --
As I understand the First Amendment it applies to speech",1,8,12
1685,but where conduct is prohibited by a lawful statute,0,0,12
1686,"The mere fact that that conduct is progated with communication that is that conduct comes in to effect though communication doesn't prevent, the First Amendment does not prevent in such a situation",2,2,12
1687,"The interference with the communication, the communication may be interfered with",2,5,12
1688,"because the interference is essentially with conduct and the mere fact that it is the conduct is --
The conduct is the disclosure of the patient's secrets",2,5,12
1689,"The betrayal of the patient's confidence, that is the conduct your Honor",2,5,12
1690,"And it is accomplished through book, it would be conduct if it was expressed orally and it doesn't become sacred",2,2,12
1691,because it is a book,2,5,12
1692,"Certainly, Your Honor",0,0,12
1693,"Yes, Your honor",2,5,12
1694,"Except giving it wider publicity, then that it might receive if it were merely put into the library",2,5,12
1695,"But may I return to this question--
Of this particular nature, I think not your Honor",0,0,12
1696,"Not without the agreement --
Not at all, Your Honor",2,5,12
1697,I've quoted Dr,1,10,12
1698,"Freud to the effect that no matter what happens, one must not do anything to betray the patient, and if one is faced with the necessity of not publishing or betraying the patient one does not publish",1,10,12
1699,"But again, there is a statute here and may I speak a little of New York practice",2,2,12
1700,The New York Court of Appeals is a court of very limited jurisdiction,2,2,12
1701,"And the constitution of the State of New York provides that the Court of Appeals may not pass questions of pact, that by the way is set out of page 1A in the appendix",2,2,12
1702,"The Court of Appeals may not review any question or fact at all, unless the appellate division in an interlocutory judgment, finds new facts or in it's auto granting leave to appeal new facts are set forth",2,2,12
1703,"Now, I think almost every practitioner in that court knows that rule and in point or should know the rule and then there is another statute, so that the Court of Appeals may pass upon questions of law in the context of a particular case and in the context or facts",2,2,12
1704,"There is a statute, 5612, which is again in the appendix which provides that if there are not new findings or fact in the opinion of the Court or in its order or in the auto granting leave to appeal then the Court of Appeals must assume that those facts were determined in favor of the party who is the respondent, who is the patient here",2,3,12
1705,"And questionably there is a disputed fact here, at least there is disagreement with respect to whether there was identification",1,10,12
1706,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,12
1707,It doesn't --,0,0,12
1708,because there were many who knew of her doctor,2,5,12
1709,"We, we, we could Your Honor",2,5,12
1710,but we can go very much further,0,0,12
1711,"because we say that the patient --
I think we do Your Honor on that alone,",2,5,12
1712,but it does go much further and may I just speak once again for a moment about this statutory presumption that the identification was found and that the Court of Appeals is bound by that,0,0,12
1713,Mr,0,0,12
1714,"Karpatkin, the attorney for the psychiatrist in case wrote a reply brief in which he complained three times",2,3,12
1715,But he's not bound by this section,0,0,12
1716,"because it wasn't a call to his attention and the Court of Appeals, and he says we must have waived that right to rely on this rule of practice,",2,5,12
1717,"because it wasn't discussed in the Court of Appeals and he discusses this as a kind of arcane statute, that's his word",2,2,12
1718,"There's nothing mysterious or secret about this statute, it's published in all of the book practice",2,2,12
1719,And in permanent inc and in point of fact we did call Mr,2,5,12
1720,Karpatkin's attention to that section in our Court of Appeals brief although he three times denied that we did,2,5,12
1721,"At page 14 of our brief to the Court of Appeals, we did discussed the section, we said the court must presume to any question, in fact in dispute, were resolved by the appellate division in favor of the respondent",2,2,12
1722,And then cited civil practice law and rules 5612b,2,3,12
1723,"May I, by the way have the Court's permission to respond to some errors, misstatements of fact in the reply brief by the letter to this Court?
I'm just trying to say you find it my favor",0,0,12
1724,I'm sorry,1,9,12
1725,"I think it is the much more favorable finding that is binding upon --
No, no",1,8,12
1726,The fact is that this is by operation of law,2,2,12
1727,"It is the contention of the patient here, that she is easily identified by a large number of unique facts of her life, so that anyone who knew her and read the book would be able to identify",2,5,12
1728,"Or in fact, a lady did identify, we have her as a witness in the case below",2,5,12
1729,"Now, it is that broad question of identification that we say is binding by reason of a statute",1,10,12
1730,"No, Your Honor,",0,0,12
1731,because Your Honors assuming a situation which I would representing the appellant,2,5,12
1732,And the appellant is the one that has the facts resolved against the appellant,2,5,12
1733,"It is not the respondent, that doesn't work us against the respondent at all it works only in the respondent's favor, where a particular manner and method of appeal is taken",2,2,12
1734,Now as a matter of fact Mr,1,10,12
1735,"Karpatkin had the option of requesting findings a fact that the appellant division and invariably they are granted, it may have been those findings would have been against him",2,5,12
1736,And it maybe for that reason that he did not want to ask the court to make specific findings or fact,2,5,12
1737,but he certainly did not make those findings,0,0,12
1738,In any attorney who wants to go to the Court of Appeals and have questions of disputed facts considered by that court must raise those questions or fact and they were not raised by the psychiatrist in this case not even in the request for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals,2,2,12
1739,"The request indicates that the appeal was sort only on the question of fact, I mean on the question of law I'm sorry, and that no disputed questions of fact",2,7,12
1740,"No, Your Honor",2,5,12
1741,"Only --
The case comes to you as to the facts with the appellate division opinion, which modified the court at special term and in addition --
The fact finding with respect to identification is that the patient was readily identifiable from the text of the book and anyone who knew the patient, although the name did not appear in the book would immediately know that she was the subject to the book",2,5,12
1742,That is the extent of it and no less Your Honor,2,2,12
1743,Widely known and certainly in any people who knew her and who knew the events of her life,2,5,12
1744,"Well, that would be it",0,0,12
1745,but it would be known I think to anybody who knew that her husband was a man who began to practice the law at the age of 50 and prior at that time had been a speech writer and that she had a son that was a musical prodigy,2,3,12
1746,These are relatively unique facts,1,8,12
1747,"I don't see that we have a final judgment Your Honor,",1,10,12
1748,but I think this comes within the exception that case law has made,0,0,12
1749,"I think the case was properly before the court, I did --
Yes, Your Honor",2,5,12
1750,"But there was the Giff case, the organization for Giff case, in which a preliminary injunction did in fact come before this Court, and the Court stated that it had jurisdiction, and we are not contesting the jurisdiction of the Court in this case",2,2,12
1751,"I understood--
Oh, no",0,0,12
1752,"No, there isn't that fact in this case and we are stipulating
Yes, Your Honor",2,5,12
1753,"On the examinations before trial alone I understood from Your Honors now that we may send you a letter and I --
I would just like to add one word with respect to the procedures that are followed before preliminary injunction is granted",2,2,12
1754,"In New York State, preliminary injunction is merely an adjunct to the final injunction that may be granted or denied",2,2,12
1755,"And it is a temporary order granted simply to be certain that if final relief is given to the plaintiff in the case, that final relief will not be meaningless,",0,0,12
1756,because if the temporary injunction was not granted we would have the sale of the book and it wouldn't have done us any good after a period of time to get the final injunction,2,5,12
1757,"Now, you did have evidence submitted by affidavit, you did have all argument briefs, all the requirements of due process are met, even the demand that a valid cause of action be proved before the injunction can be granted",2,5,12
1758,"There is—it was indicated before a right even to ask for an evidentiary hearing with respect to any crucial fact, any crucial disputed fact",2,2,12
1759,And Mr,0,0,12
1760,"Karpatkin's only complained about that right or about that section allowing a hearing on the disputed fact is that if he asked for it, the Court might have refused to give it to him,",2,5,12
1761,"because the fact in this case are complex, they certainly aren't complex, they couldn't be simpler",2,5,12
1762,"All that we have here is a simple problem of the book, the revelations in the book, and the problem of identification which I think is evident from the book itself",1,8,12
1763,Thank you,0,0,12
1764,Mr,0,0,13
1765,"Chief Justice, if the Court please",0,0,13
1766,"I represent the petitioners in this case who are a group of railroad labor organizations, commonly referred to as shop craft unions as well as some of their subsidiary component local unions who were enjoined along with the respondent Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company some 15 years ago from discriminating against a group of non-union plaintiffs with respect to affording those plaintiffs' full and equal enjoyment of all of the rights given to them and other employees in their respective crafts, under collective bargaining agreements that were negotiated between this petitioner organizations in the railroad company",2,5,13
1767,"We are now here seeking for reversal of decisions of the courts below which refuse to modify that old injunction to the extent of permitting us to ask the railroad to execute a union shop, union security agreement with this petitioner labor organizations as bargaining representatives",2,2,13
1768,"The type of agreement we sought to negotiate of course is the type that was authorized by the 1951 amendments to Railway Labor Act which came along some six years after this old injunction was issued and which subject to enumerated safeguards, did authorize union security agreements in the railroad industry which had previous had been an open shop industry",2,2,13
1769,And this Court is very familiar with that in view of the decision in the Hanson case which was the first time that those 1951 amendments had been held to be constitutional,2,5,13
1770,"We petition for modification of this injunction in accordance with Rule 60 (b) subparagraph 5 under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which authorizes modification of an injunction in its prospective application when circumstances have so changed as to make it inequitable for the injunction to be continued in an effect -- in effect in its original form",2,5,13
1771,"What we --
It appears at page 14 of our brief Your Honor, our original brief",2,5,13
1772,"What we asked the Courts to do was not to vacate the injunction, not to open the door to any unlawful discrimination against these original plaintiffs and members of their class,",2,5,13
1773,but simply to give us a pro tanto modification,0,0,13
1774,So that the injunction which at time of its issuance had declared and protected plaintiffs' rights under the Railway Labor Act as it existed at that time would now be modified so that it would protect the rights of these plaintiffs and their class under the Railway Labor Act in its present form,2,2,13
1775,"And we sought and obtained a review by this Court on three questions that we urged that were involved, three points in which we stated that the courts below aired in the decision that they reached",2,2,13
1776,"First of all, the Courts concluded, both the District Court and the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals which was primarily a paraphrasing of the decision and reasoning of the District Court, the Courts concluded first that the amendment of the Railway Labor Act is so as to permit union shop agreements, which had previously been unlawful, was not a sufficient change in circumstances as to justify removing this injunctive prohibition against our negotiating such agreements",0,0,13
1777,Then they also ruled that in view of the fact that the original decree of an injunction had been a consent decree rather than a decree written by the Court following a complete trial and litigation of the old suit,2,5,13
1778,"Therefore, we must be deemed to have agreed with this original plaintiff's and their class that never at anytime in the future would we ever negotiate a union shop agreement",2,5,13
1779,So the courts below both fell into the error that this Court come in to (Inaudible) Swift case of treating the consent decree as a contract rather than as a judicial act,1,10,13
1780,"And third, both courts --
Yes Your Honor, and of course in the Swift case, this Court discussed that concept in considerable length",2,2,13
1781,"And third, both of the courts below give such comments in their opinions to evidence submitted over the objections of the moving parties, the petitioners here that -- that we must consider that they give weight to it and -- and give it effect in refusing to modify injunction",2,5,13
1782,"That evidence was to the effect that as a result of an economic strike on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad in 1955, they remain a great deal of bitterness and hostility among the employees of the railroad and the evidence showed that these petitioner organizations had find and expelled members who worked during the strike",2,5,13
1783,The L & M claim that 2500 of these employees stayed at work during the strike,2,2,13
1784,"And now, they came in this proceeding to modify the old injunction to permit us and negotiate a union shop and urged that",2,5,13
1785,"because there was this antipathy among the employee groups, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the original injunction against discrimination in the enjoinment of contract rights, had nothing whatever to do with this union shop agreement",2,5,13
1786,but was simply bitterness in strike out of -- between strikers and strike breakers that this should be construed as holding us without clean hands and,0,0,13
1787,hence not entitled to negotiate the union shop agreement,2,2,13
1788,Yes Your Honor that -- Judge Sherburne's opinion appears at page 69 of the record,2,5,13
1789,It's -- it goes from page 69 to page 80,2,5,13
1790,"Now, I think it's important to have in mind the nature of the discrimination that was charged in the original complaint, it illustrates that I have nothing to do with this so-called bitterness or hostility",1,10,13
1791,"What these plaintiffs originally complaining about was the fact that the non-union employees they alleged had been -- had been denied equal opportunities for promotions from one category of employment to another, had been denied their fair share of overtime assignments, and had been denied certain attributes of their seniority status, all claim to be governed by the contracts between the company and the organization in certain matters such as picking man to be temporarily upgraded from helper to a temporary mechanics job or in assigning men to be called for overtime in particular jobs",2,5,13
1792,There is discretion that's exercised by a local foreman and a local union committee in deciding who they think to be the best man to be upgraded,2,2,13
1793,And that was the gist of this original action,0,0,13
1794,There was no question of a union shop agreement back in 1945,1,10,13
1795,"But this Court just prior of entry of this consent decree, had decided the landmark Steele and Tunstall cases which contained a complete and new to all of us exposition of the statutory fiduciary duty of bargaining agents and the carriers under the Railway Labor Act not to join in discriminating against members of the class representative",2,2,13
1796,"Now up until the Steele and Tunstall cases were decided of course the -- as this Court knows from having reversed both the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, there was a quite a body of authority relied upon by many course to the affect that you couldn't maintain a lawsuit based on discrimination which was joined in by the company and the union",2,2,13
1797,"But, when these cases were decided, there was no longer any point in litigating this lawsuit on the original complaint for the purpose of trying to create any precedent",2,5,13
1798,"The precedent was there for us, this Courts opinion in the Steele and Tunstall cases practically wrote the form of our consent decree force",2,5,13
1799,"But then when we came along after the Railroad Labor Act was amended as to permit a union shop agreement, the railroad suddenly said, ""Do as, well, we won't sign that agreement with you",2,5,13
1800,because somebody is going to hold us some contempt of this old decree that says we can't discriminate based on non-membership in the union,2,5,13
1801,"""
So, that's was this case is about and that's what precipitated this motion to modify the injunction",0,0,13
1802,"Now, probably one of the most basic concepts on modification of injunctions is it in -- in injunction does not create a right",1,10,13
1803,"but simply furnishes the protection, a remedy for the protection of a right which must find its source some place else",2,5,13
1804,"In this case, the source of the right asserted in the original complaint was the Railway Labor Act",2,2,13
1805,It was the statutory fiduciary duty defined by this Court in the Steele and Tunstall cases,2,2,13
1806,"Now, our position to support of the modification and the injunction is quite simple, these rights stems from the statute",2,5,13
1807,The statute has now been amended so as to change the nature of the right,1,10,13
1808,"And if we don't have the injunction modified to conform to this change, we're confronted with the situation of these petitioners continuing under threat of this injunction, under panic contempt proceedings for violating it, continuing to be prohibited from negotiating agreements which Congress has said in these words, ""They shall be permitted to negotiate",2,5,13
1809,"""
And the original plaintiffs and the people that have been intervened in these more recent proceedings would be continued to be protected, would continue to have this injunctive remedy for the protection of a right which is no longer in existence",0,0,13
1810,And of course aside from the inequity of being prohibited from engaging in con -- conduct which is lawful and which Congress said it is desirable now for national public policy in the railroad industry to prevent free riders to require employees to bear their fair share or the cost of burden -- the cost in the burden of collective bargaining,2,5,13
1811,"In addition to -- to just the inequity of being prohibited from doing something that you have a legal right to do, there is of course the additional very substantial financial consideration that's involved in which these petitioners are seeking the right to enjoy",2,5,13
1812,"We have by railroads argument in this brief, I believe this claim that 2500 employees work during the strike and that everybody that work doing the strike was expelled from the union or was not a member of the union to begin with",2,3,13
1813,But we took a very small figure for the amount of dues income that would be lost by these organizations as a result of being kept under this injunction,2,5,13
1814,I suspect a very conservative estimate what the dues lost would be if you would assume 1% of an employer's monthly earnings for -- for his monthly dues,1,10,13
1815,"I suppose you have between $100,000 to $200,000 to this lawsuit dues to these group of petitioners so, this is not a situation where the petitioners are not suffering any particular inequity or in any particular wrong or not hurting from the continuously injunction",1,10,13
1816,"I don't know what Your Honor means,",0,0,13
1817,but --,0,0,13
1818,"but types ---
That was a racial discrimination case",0,0,13
1819,That was a racial discrimination case,2,2,13
1820,Yes,1,12,13
1821,"And assuming in that they were a members of different crafts, they were operating crafts and the shop crafts",2,2,13
1822,"Well they -- they are -- sorry, the answer to your question Your Honor is yes",2,5,13
1823,They can be,2,2,13
1824,And we would very much like to be able to require them to join and to make their contributions to the overall cost to collective bargaining,2,2,13
1825,"Now, there is one point that and one only that runs through all of the briefs of the respondents, both the respondent, Railroad Company and the individual employee response",1,10,13
1826,"That is this idea of an agreement, an agreement to the agreement",2,2,13
1827,They don't speak of the decree,2,2,13
1828,They speak of the decree and the agreement,2,2,13
1829,And they give the impression they try to give the impression in their briefs as they seem to have succeeded in doing with the District Court that this was not an ordinary kind of a consent decree of injunction,2,5,13
1830,but it was something a little unusual,0,0,13
1831,"The say that we agreed in some kind of a tripartite agreement between the plaintiffs, the company and the unions that there would be never be a union security agreement negotiated on this property",2,2,13
1832,The fact is there is no such agreement and we challenge counsel in the District Court and the Court of Appeals and we've done it here to point to any place in the record where there is such agreement,2,5,13
1833,"We have further demonstrated that by reference to their own briefs, that when press, what they say is that the decree was the agreement",2,5,13
1834,"And they say that by the act of settling the case by a consent decree therefore, we must by some magical method be assumed to have entered into some implied agreement",2,2,13
1835,We would not ever negotiate the union shop agreement,2,2,13
1836,"No, the District Court said he had power to modify the injunction",2,3,13
1837,"but then he cons -- construed this consent decree as I've said as being a contract, an agreement, strictly contradiction to what this Court has so plainly and clearly stated in the Swift case",0,0,13
1838,Yes -- yes Your Honor,0,0,13
1839,Not that we would never seek a modification,2,5,13
1840,He said that we must be held to have agreed that we would never attempt to negotiate a union shop,2,3,13
1841,And we didn't agree to that,1,10,13
1842,"What we did, we agreed to an injunction to the entry of a consent decree of an injunction enjoining us from this broad range of discrimination",2,5,13
1843,There is no side agreement,1,10,13
1844,There is no covenant undesirable,2,5,13
1845,The Court retain jurisdiction expressly in the injunction,2,5,13
1846,Page 36 of the record Your Honor,2,3,13
1847,"Page 38, the bottom of the page, the Court says, ""The Court retains control of this act to the purpose of entering such further orders has may be became necessary or proper",2,3,13
1848,"""
And of course as we have pointed out, under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules, the Court expressly possesses that far with or without reservation, it's also part of the general principles of equity to jurisprudence even before the Rule was spelled out and that clearly, the Court does posses its power",0,0,13
1849,"Well, Mr",0,0,13
1850,"Justice Black if -- if such a contract rather than the Railway Labor Act were the basis for the Court's order of injunction, the Court would have no jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act",2,2,13
1851,He -- he couldn't base his -- his decree on a contract,2,5,13
1852,He had to be enforcing the obligation of the statute,2,5,13
1853,"because under this Court's decision in the Graham case, this was made very clear that this discrimination case didn't wipe out Norris-LaGuardia and that unless the plaintiff were speaking to enforce some positive mandate of the Railway Labor Act in one of these injunction suits",2,5,13
1854,The Norris-LaGuardia Act would prevent the issuance for an injunction,2,2,13
1855,"No, Your Honor",2,5,13
1856,That is all the evidence through this,2,2,13
1857,"The parties entered into a release or by the plaintiffs released their claims for back damages upon the payment by defendants of $5000 and second, the defendants agreed to the entry of a consent decree which decree appears at page 36 and that is all or there is",2,2,13
1858,There is no other agreement,1,10,13
1859,There's been no effort made,2,2,13
1860,"The point to any other agreement --
-- except to say that this must be construed as cascading one",2,2,13
1861,"When they argued for it, they don't say here's the agreement at page such and such of the record",2,5,13
1862,They simply argue in this very well,2,2,13
1863,This decree of injunction didn't come from the air,2,5,13
1864,It had to come from some place so,2,5,13
1865,"therefore there must have been an agreement and yet, they and the Court of Appeals below said that the decree wasn't -- the decree became the agreement",2,3,13
1866,"So, what they're doing, they're electing the -- to the decree as the source for some implied agreement",2,5,13
1867,"At page 152 on the --
-- sentence of sentence of the -- the next to the last paragraph",2,2,13
1868,"The Court says, ""When the injunction was issued?
The parties herein by their consent thereto provided that no such requirement of union membership should there have to be in effect in any bargaining agreement",2,5,13
1869,"""
They're looking to the consent decree as to the description and definition and source of this theoretical outside -- side separate covenant or agreement",2,2,13
1870,And the fact of course is that the procedure that was followed in settling this lawsuit by the answer that consent decree was precisely the same as you will find in any case where there's a consent decree of an injunction,2,5,13
1871,"And if we hold that under those circumstances, the consent natures the decree bars us on some agreement theory then it would be equally -- it would equally bar modification of an injunction in any case where the injunction was by consent",2,5,13
1872,"The Court of Appeals as they have a counsel for response and as I recollect, he said he did claim it was in perpetuity",2,5,13
1873,"No, it was the separate release",2,5,13
1874,but I don't recall whether that release was ever entered into the record in this case,0,0,13

1876,however and I have no -- no particular quarrel with their statement of facts as to the nature and scope of -- of what the settlement consisted of it,2,5,13

Not and -- I don't believe he did in 1945",2,2,13
1884,"He did in our 1958 motion of my advisory (Voice Overlap) --
If it's reproduced here, I -- I don't find it in here so I -- I guess we can't consider it part of the record except that I have no quarrel with the statement of counsel that that is what took place",0,0,13
1885,It's recited at page 5 and 6 on the brief for counsel other than the respondent now and then,2,2,13
1886,"The parties agreed to one, the entering of the consent decree going on to describe what the decree would be",2,2,13
1887,"Page 5 of the brief -- the green brief for respondents --
-- other than -- other than Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company",2,3,13
1888,"The parties agreed to one, the entering of the consent decree two, the waiver and release by the plaintiffs, the law claims against the defendants for damages and three, the payment of the sum of $5000 by the defendants to the plaintiffs",2,2,13
1889,"That is your settlement of the lawsuit and then the Court entered the decree -- the consent decree which the parties had written up, that -- that is the agreement",2,2,13
1890,So that there -- there is no agreement separate in the parts from the decree,2,2,13
1891,"We just get together and said, ""We'll settle this lawsuit by getting with -- agreeing and stipulating if the Court may sign this decree, let me paying you some money and you get him your release",2,5,13
1892,"""
That -- that is the agreement -- and that is the only agreement that there is and it's -- it's about the most minimal kind of a -- an agreement you could ever have in any consent decree of injunction",2,5,13
1893,"So that if the Court post that such a settlement of a case bars subsequent modification when the facts clearly demand the modification, the equities demanded, then I don't see how we can ever modify any consent --
We have --
We have mentioned that on our brief Your Honor",0,0,13
1894,"There is no right of the Court to exercise discretion in the ordinary sense, one of the questions before purely a matter of law",1,10,13

1896,There's no issue of burden of proof there or anything,2,2,13
1897,"We say that the statute was change -- was completely eliminated, pro tanto, the right that the injunction previously protected and the Court has no discretion to misapply the law, if it were request of weighing evidence or having at some appraisal as to what the effect of this modification might be for factual point of views and to review the discretion",2,5,13

1899,Mr,0,0,13
1900,"Chief Justice, I wanted to state that particularly with respect to this agreement argument",1,10,13
1901,I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that Mr,2,5,13
1902,"Eldred, when called upon to read the agreement, turned to page 36 to 37 of the record and what he read was the course decree which -- which simply serves to emphasize a -- a statement that what Mr",2,2,13
1903,Eldred and the Court -- and the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the language which he read to you held that that decree was an underlying agreement,2,3,13
1904,That would -- the decree itself that they said was the agreement,2,2,13
1905,"And of course, we argue here and it is our position that it was error where the Court too so hold and it was directly contrary to the Swift case",2,5,13
1906,"And one -- one further point I would like to finish was --
-- he turned -- he read the -- from the release for a while and then we he got down to the declaration of rights, he was reading from page 37 of the record, the decree",0,0,13
1907,"He says that when -- when Your -- Your Honors pressed him for more language as to what the obligations and what the prohibitions were, where was the agreement that said, what they were prohibited from doing, what he read was the decree and that of course is what we're here seeking to modify",2,2,13
1908,"Well, I think that 28 people were just a -- a group that claimed they could show some wage loss or (Inaudible) missed out on some overtime assignments or promotions and --
No, this is not --
This is not a racial case",2,2,13
1909,I think there are probably some of both,1,8,13

1915,Eldred down the consideration concept and settlement of this thing for $5000,2,5,13
1916,"The -- the Swift case would seem to say that the fact that 28 people might have entered into such a contract if there were any contract, wouldn't justify preventing a union shop agreement to be negotiated for anybody else except for those 28 people",0,0,13
1917,"Well, we learn as we go along",2,5,13
1918,The claim was really a -- a claim of agreement violations,2,2,13
1919,This case was decided before this Court decided the cases Local against Steele and W,2,2,13
1920,"which created the concept of exclusive jurisdiction in the National Railroad Adjustment Board and I think where we going back to retry this lawsuit, we might well have had quite a hassle as to whether these men wouldn't have had to file their claims for deprival of overtime under the overtime rule with the National Railroad Adjustment Board",2,5,13
1921,But they -- they argued that they had gotten deprive over fair share,2,5,13
1922,because they were not members of the union,2,5,13
1923,"Yes, it was a grievance based under the language of the collective bargaining agreement",2,5,13

Yes",2,5,13

1929,because they weren't parties that running contractual undertake,2,2,13
1930,I wasn't there Your Honor,2,3,13
1931,"There was --
But I don't believe there was --
-- any hearing -- you're talking about the 1945 decree",2,5,13
1932,"The decree was drawn up by the parties in conferences between the parties to the lawsuit and exchanged drafts and proposals as to what the decree are to recite and then it was --
-- stipulated that it would be submitted to the judge for a signature",2,2,13

1934,"I don't believe there was argument --
I'm sure you wanted to know what the case all about",2,3,13
1935,"Well, that's a subject to disputed propaganda claims",2,5,13

1960,"Chief Justice, members of the Court, this is my initial appearance before the Court",2,5,15
1961,I hope that in these difficult areas of pre-emption and 301 which have been likened to Delphic mysteries and dark rooms that I won't be able to be of assistance to the Court,2,5,15
1962,We do have a subject of pre-emption and I submit to the Court that we're at the bedrock of whether or not the doctrine of pre-emption in the area of labor contracts is relevant and can be applied at all,2,2,15
1963,"And as to the reach and scope of 301, I think we have finally come to the question of whether Westinghouse is alive or dead, were used Mr",2,5,15
1964,Harris' remark which I liken a dustbin of history,1,10,15
1965,We must determine it seems to me in this action whether this suit by an individual employee for back pay is within the purview of that section or not,1,10,15
1966,"because we are at least agreed that if this suit is not governed by federal common law, that then though it be on a contract, pre-emption should apply",1,10,15
1967,I referred to the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice,2,3,15
1968,"But --
No",0,0,15
1969,That I realized Your Honor,1,12,15
1970,"Well, if I recall this --
We would like the Court to listen to us in that area if we might",0,0,15
1971,"We think there are strong reasons why this very same point should be considered and with Your Honors permissions, I would like to speak about it briefly",1,8,15
1972,"My recollection of the Gonzales was that it was a suit against the union by an employee, that within the reach of 301 and they did apply state law",2,2,15
1973,And of course as Your Honor mentioned this pre-emption did not apply,2,2,15
1974,"but if you will recall, I think the majority distinguished that on the basis that it was so to speak on the periphery of the National Labor Relations Act obviously something that the Board could not have acted upon",2,2,15
1975,We're here at the heart of the National Labor Relations Act as it's always existed in the area of unfair labor practices,2,5,15
1976,This is not a peripheral matter,1,8,15
1977,"Now, it's been customary -- I shouldn't say customary",0,0,15
1978,but this Court has always approached pre-emption cases on a case by case basis,1,10,15
1979,We also adopt the position of the petitioner in Lincoln Mills who said that the correct approach is to decide each case as it comes along,2,2,15
1980,We've become involved in a great many hypothetical cases in a reading of the Solicitor General's brief and of our Brother Harris' brief which are not involved here,2,5,15
1981,"For that reason, we would like with the Court's permission to briefly restate the facts",1,10,15
1982,because we think they are very important to this case,2,2,15
1983,Our issues are very narrow and our contentions are accordingly narrow,1,8,15
1984,"The respondent is a publisher of a Daily and Sunday Newspaper in the City of Detroit, Michigan",2,3,15
1985,"It was stipulated, it was engaged in interstate commerce, that the petitioner was a janitor as were his assignors",2,5,15
1986,They belong to a local of the National Guild with whom the respondent had a labor contract,2,5,15
1987,We had 14 other contracts with various trades and crafts such as pressmen and the like,2,5,15
1988,"On December 1st of 1955, a strike occurred caused by a union other than the Guild which lasted approximately a month and a half",2,3,15
1989,"During this strike, most of our organized labor was laid off altogether such as the pressmen stereotype persons and the like be unorganized working force consisting primarily of editorial business and advertising employees continued to work full time",2,5,15
1990,"As petitioner says, and we must concede for the purpose of this argument with no work available",0,0,15
1991,The petitioner as a janitor worked part time,2,5,15
1992,"Upon the resumption of publication, all crafts and employees were recalled and worked from then on full time",2,3,15
1993,This action was brought for back pay based on the collective agreement and the breach of only one paragraph of that agreement which I would like to refer to,2,3,15
1994,It appears on page 4 of the record,2,2,15
1995,"There shall be no discrimination --

1999,All parties have regarded this section as being nothing more than the paraphrasing of the obligations contained in Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act,1,10,15
2000,I think it's so regarded,1,9,15
2001,To us it is no more than had the parties agreed to abide by Section 8 (a) (3) by reference and had the union agreed to abide by Section 8 (b) of the Act,2,2,15
2002,"In other words, incorporation by reference and as Mr",0,0,15
2003,-- our Brother Harris has made clear in his answer to Mr,0,0,15
2004,"Justice White's question, this was the sole basis for the action",1,10,15
2005,"An unfair labor practice charge was never filed, either by the petitioners or by the union, or by anyone on their behalf",2,3,15
2006,The action in the state court was a simple -- of some said action by the individual employees based on breach of contract,2,3,15
2007,The union was not a party,1,10,15
2008,No relief was sought on its behalf,2,2,15
2009,"So far as this record is concerned, its views are unknown",2,5,15
2010,It was commenced after the six months period provided in Section 10 (a) for the filing of charges had elapsed,2,2,15
2011,And under our local statute of limitations could have been commenced at anytime within six years,2,2,15
2012,"As to damages and I might at that point answer, I think Mr",0,0,15
2013,"Justice Stewart's question, it is not required to my knowledge under Michigan law that the individual sue -- the union could sue his assignee and this jurisdiction incidentally at least in Michigan has existed for I would say at least 40 years",2,5,15
2014,There is a well developed body of Michigan law relating to the rights of individuals under collective bargaining agreements particularly Cortez versus Ford Motor which is a relative in recent case and (Inaudible) -- reviews of the prior decisions of the Court,2,2,15
2015,I believe that that can be done if they are an assignee,1,8,15
2016,They cannot do it in their own rights so to speak,2,2,15
2017,Absent an assignee,2,5,15
2018,but I know of no obstacle to their suing if they are suing as an assignee,0,0,15
2019,Exactly,1,12,15
2020,"In other words, there is no difference that the Michigan law regards the employee as a third party beneficiary",1,10,15
2021,"Some states, they regard it as principal agent and so forth",2,2,15
2022,Exactly,1,12,15
2023,"Because we have to conclude the parties, Mr",0,0,15
2024,Justice Goldberg and the only way we can satisfy a judgment is where the parties are actually before the Court,2,2,15
2025,As to damages recovery was sought solely of back pay consisting of the difference between what this employee would have recovered had he worked full time and had he worked part time,2,5,15
2026,"This is the identical relief that he could have secured from the Board, had he gone to the Board",2,2,15
2027,There is no difference that we know of,1,10,15
2028,And finally we brought the motion to dismiss as our Brother Harris has stated it and I think there's one element of humor that entered into this,1,10,15
2029,but which is illustrative of the state court's reaction to these matters,0,0,15
2030,"Our pretrial judge who happens to be one of our best trial judges, this appears at page 23 of the record",2,5,15
2031,"He said after reciting the facts, let's be blunt about it if this Court could settle this controversy, if it settle with difference between the western powers in Russia",2,2,15
2032,I know when I'm licked,2,2,15
2033,"This simply illustrates the complete lack of knowledge of state court judges in the area of unfair labor practices, never had the occasion to consider these things and confront it with them why they are if they admit -- whether they admit it or not licked",1,9,15
2034,Now we would like to consider with the Court if we might very briefly the question of pre-emption,1,10,15
2035,because we would like to submit that that issue was not foreclosed by the decisions of the last term upon which my Brother relies,2,5,15
2036,We have here gentlemen a situation where this Court is asked to create a concurrent and independent jurisdiction over conduct which is cognizable before the Board as an unfair labor practice,2,2,15
2037,It is said that this is different,1,8,15
2038,because it's a contract,2,5,15
2039,I submit that this is a difference in form and not in substance,1,10,15
2040,"If the petitioner is correct then we have a situation where we have a raise of diligence as was mentioned in connection with the Railway Labor Act cases, with one party running to the Board perhaps and another party running to the Courts",2,2,15
2041,"We have a situation where we are injecting the courts into an area totally foreign to them, where they will be asked to give a secondhand reading to Board decisions",2,5,15
2042,We are bypassing the procedures and the practices which Congress established specifically as stated in Garner to develop these peculiar distinctive rights which we find in Section 8 and Section 7 of the Act,2,5,15
2043,We find nothing I submit if it is carefully examined in the legislative history that indicates this,2,2,15
2044,"The principle argument for the proposition that this is so is that Congress and specifically Senate Bill 1126 included the provision which would have made a breach of contract and unfair labor practice, cognizable by the Board",2,2,15
2045,This was also true of Section 301 or its antecedent I should say,1,8,15
2046,"So that under the Senate Bill as proposed, we would have had two remedies; one before the Board and one before the Courts",2,2,15
2047,"Eventually as a result of conference this was dropped and as a House Conference Report decided, my Brother Harris quoted it",2,2,15
2048,It chose to leave the matter to the usual processes of the law,2,2,15
2049,I think in this connection that there is a significant statement which unfortunately I've been trudging through the legislative history for a month or so now and I did not find at the time I wrote my brief,2,5,15
2050,but I would like to call it to the attention of the Court,0,0,15
2051,And that is the remarks of Senator Taft explaining the conference agreement which to me is of equal if not more significance than the House Conference Report,2,2,15
2052,"He had this to say, it appears in the congressional record of the Senate, June 5th, 1947 and can be found in Volume 2 of the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act, Government Printing Office at page 1539",2,3,15
2053,"He says this in pertinent part, when the bill passed the Senate, it also contained a sixth paragraph in this subsection, Section 8 (a) (6) which made it an unfair labor practice for an employer to violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or the terms of an agreement to submit a labor dispute to arbitration",2,2,15
2054,The House conferees objected to this provision on the ground that it would have the effect of making the terms of every collective agreement subject to interpretation and determination by the Board rather than the courts,2,2,15
2055,The Senate conferees ultimately agreed to its elimination as well as the deletion of a similar provision contained in sec -- subsection 8 (b) (5) which governed the unions,2,2,15
2056,The provisions of the Senate amendment which conferred the right of action for damages upon a party aggrieved by a breach of a collective bargaining contract,2,2,15
2057,"however were retained in the conference agreement, that Section 301",2,2,15
2058,"If both provisions had remained, there would been -- have been a probably conflict of remedies and decisions",2,5,15
2059,"And if you study the minority report in the House, you will find that this was one of the principal objections of those opposing in the House, this proposal",0,0,15
2060,"So that we now have this peculiar situation, the Senate Bill would of course have been a part of the federal law reviewable by this Court and any diversities and conflicts between the Board's interpretation of a contract and the Court's interpretation of a contract under Section 301 would have been reviewable by this Court",2,5,15
2061,"Nonetheless, Congress decided that this was not right",2,5,15
2062,because of the possibility of conflict,2,5,15
2063,"And yet in this case, gentlemen, what this petitioner seeks is to vest jurisdiction concurrently in the Board under the guise of breach of contracts and we will have even though it is reviewable",2,5,15
2064,"because controlled by sub-federal substantive law or part of 301, we will have the same confusion and conflict and we will have it many times over",2,5,15
2065,"because we will have the trial courts throughout the country state and federal open to every litigant regardless of amount, regardless of diversity of citizenship",2,2,15
2066,And we say that this is not something that the contract or rather that the Congress considered a desirable result,2,2,15
2067,"Now, I would like to also make it clear that our contention is very narrow",1,10,15
2068,We only seek the result which we do in those cases where the collective agreement by reference paraphrase or what have you incorporates into the contract an unfair labor practice where the Board can give relief,2,2,15
2069,We have no sympathy for the use of pre-emption in the contract action as a complete defense to any liability,1,10,15
2070,We do not suggest that our responsibility be avoided,1,9,15
2071,"All we seek is to channelized into the expertise and knowledge of the Board, matters that are as clearly an unfair labor practice as this",1,10,15
2072,We do not attempt to unseek arbitration,1,8,15
2073,because we believe if this case were to fall,2,2,15
2074,because this Court felt that arbitration would be affected then we would withdraw,2,5,15
2075,because all of us who work in that labor field have a growing respect for arbitration,1,8,15
2076,"It is a peculiar institution, it is favored by Congress, it is favored by the courts, and more importantly, it has been favored by the Board",2,2,15
2077,since its inception,2,2,15
2078,"As the Solicitor General points out in his brief, the Board has always had an attitude of accommodation towards arbitration, in fact, has insisted upon it in many occasions",1,10,15
2079,"So that we do not feel that the reach of our argument affects arbitration and of course, there is no arbitration present here",2,2,15
2080,"What is the practical effect?
They say, ""No, it doesn't affect the Board's jurisdiction as such",2,5,15
2081,"""
That is certainly so, it does not",1,12,15
2082,"But it encourages every employee in such a situation to bypass the Board and how can the Board effectuate public policy if you provide another forum and say to that employee, “Here is another place to go",2,2,15
2083,"”
Perhaps they are more receptive",1,10,15
2084,"Its forum shopping, that's what it is as far as I'm concerned",2,2,15
2085,"And it substitutes as I have said for the Board's expertise and knowledge, a state court's ignorance and secondhand reading of the Board's decision",2,5,15
2086,"No sir, they had not",2,5,15
2087,Exactly,1,12,15
2088,I do not,1,12,15
2089,but I can speculate that the -- one grounds we're going to the state court was that they thought that it was more receptive than the Board at that time,0,0,15
2090,Perhaps they feel differently now,2,5,15
2091,but the point is that -- that this isn't an opportunity for forum shopping,0,0,15
2092,Mr,0,0,15
2093,"Chief Justice, members of the Court we were discussing pre-emption and I had about concluded my remarks on the practical effect of the petitioner's position it adopted",2,5,15
2094,"I want to make it clear so that there will be no misunderstanding that in our opinion, we have here a parallel remedy and a parallel right to appear before the Court and before the Board and that the relief would have been the same",1,10,15
2095,"In other words, if the petitioner could have gone to the National Labor Relations Board and it is conceded that he would've secured the same relief instead he waited beyond the statutory period before going to -- before commencing his lawsuit and he never did go to the Board",2,5,15
2096,"Now, I would like to discuss very briefly Dowd Box and Lucas Flour",1,10,15
2097,It is the petitioner's argument that Dowd Box considered this exact situation such as most certainly not the case if one reads the briefs and considers the argument of Mr,1,10,15
2098,Feller at the last term in Dowd Box,2,5,15
2099,That was a true collective right that was being enforced by the union,1,10,15
2100,"In fact, it involved the entire validity of the agreement which the company claimed was void by a reason of lack of authority in the negotiators",2,5,15
2101,"And, naturally the union was -- had a perfect right under 301 to assert the contract's validity",2,5,15
2102,"There followed a wage increase which had been included in the contract as negotiated, and there was a relief given as to that",2,5,15
2103,but that was an incidental part of the suit,0,0,15
2104,The suit was for enforcement,2,5,15
2105,The alleged unfair labor practice was a refusal to bargain and we know from the insurance agents case that the Board is in no position whatsoever to grant the same relief as the Court using its equity powers in Massachusetts which was done in Dowd Box,2,2,15
2106,"So that -- and another thing, there was no disagreement in that case about pre-emption",1,10,15
2107,"If you will read the petitioner's brief again, you will find that the petitioner claimed that pre-emption did not apply to a 301 action",2,5,15
2108,He agreed with Mr,1,12,15
2109,Feller,2,3,15
2110,What he did say was that it applied solely on the federal court,2,2,15
2111,because 301 confined jurisdiction exclusively to the federal courts so that the pre-emption wasn't argued either,2,2,15
2112,As to Lucas Flour we had no unfair labor practice at all,2,5,15
2113,It was a claim -- the claim of the union in that case as a means avoiding liability altogether that the right to strike was arguably protected,2,2,15
2114,There is a statement to the effect that it was arguably prohibited,2,2,15
2115,I don't quite understand that and I don't think Mr,1,10,15
2116,Oles who argued for Lucas Flour in that case understood it either,2,2,15
2117,"But in any event, the pre-emption rule as claimed by the respective parties in Dowd Box and Lucas Flour is not our case",2,2,15
2118,because in those cases most certainly the Board was not in a position to grant relief and couldn't have granted relief,2,5,15
2119,"And before leaving, well I should say I've one other remark to make and that is that this contract argument is deceptively simple",1,10,15
2120,"In our case, the Government brief says that pre-emption should not apply to a contract action",1,10,15
2121,Our Brother Harris admits that this is not so if substantive state law controls,1,10,15
2122,"The Government, through the Solicitor General, has several reservations about this",1,10,15
2123,He says this is right in this case,1,10,15
2124,but it is wrong as he says in his footnote at page 25 -- rather in his footnote at page 17,0,0,15
2125,"It is wrong if the contract includes a sweeping -- I think, to use his exact words -- no, he uses this",2,5,15
2126,"He says if the bargaining agreement merely adopted as such a wide range of obligations imposed by the National Labor Relations Act, imposed statutory duty to bargain collectively and so forth, then this would be a different case",2,2,15
2127,This is a different case and degree,1,8,15
2128,but I submit to the Court that it's no valid distinction,0,0,15
2129,"because Section 8 (a) (3) equally requires the expertise and knowledge of the Board as if you included in Section 7, Section 8, and the duty to bargain collectively, etcetera",2,2,15
2130,"And in Section 20 -- I mean on page 25 in his footnote, he refers to another exception and these are cases in which the Board has appeared and the claim is a contract claim",2,2,15
2131,"It involves recognition, a standard part of every contract which says that the union is the exclusive bargaining agent",2,2,15
2132,but suddenly the union loses the majority of the employees who's -- choose to be represented by another employer and the -- or rather another union and then the union who's been unseated brings an action in Court on 301 to enforce the agreement,2,2,15
2133,The Solicitor General says that here he feels that there ought to be determined by the courts to the expertise and knowledge of the Board,2,2,15
2134,"I agree -- oh, I think all we disagree on is whether or not we ought not to defer to the expertise and knowledge of the Board in this area where the contract incorporates Section 8 (a) (3)",1,10,15
2135,To us it's equally important,1,10,15
2136,"Now, as a selectee -- as a suggested solution and one supported by the reasoning of this Court in the Railway Labor Act cases and by Anson versus Hiram Walker cited in our brief which was a decision by the Seventh Circuit denied review by this Court, we feel that it should be required of an individual employee with a remedy before the Board to go to the Board first and that if the Court is approached on the same theory of exhaustion of administrative remedies, that the Court insist that he go to the Board first",2,2,15
2137,"If the Board refuses to take jurisdiction or will not issue a complaint, then he's in the position to go back to the Court",2,5,15
2138,"If the Board on the other hand takes jurisdiction as it most certainly would have in this case I think, then that's the end of the matter",2,5,15
2139,And this is suggested in the Railway Labor Act cases such as Slocum versus Delaware and Order of Railway Conductors in 339 U,2,2,15
2140,S,0,0,15
2141,"where the courts were denied the right to act where the employee had not, where the union had not gone to the Railway Adjustment Board to seek relief",2,2,15
2142,They insisted -- it was insisted by this Court in those cases that that be followed,2,2,15
2143,"Otherwise, this raise of diligence would follow and there'd be a result in conflict at least potentially",2,5,15
2144,And with that I would like to pass to the question of Section 301,0,0,15
2145,"As we see it, our argument is -- maybe summarized in this manner",1,8,15
2146,"We think that Section 301 is the basis for this federal labor law which the Court enunciated in Lincoln Mills that this Section grants rights, federal rights so to speak from which this Court is free to fashion a federal law",2,2,15
2147,"The question is what are these rights and what is the reach of this statute?
And does it apply to a suit by an individual employee for back pay?
And if it does not, what is the applicable substantive law, state or federal",0,0,15
2148,"And so I think in our quest for an answer, we start with Westinghouse",2,5,15
2149,Westinghouse of course was by -- there was no majority opinion in Westinghouse,2,5,15
2150,"but the feeling I think of those in the majority was that these were uniquely personal or individual rights and that Congress did not contemplate in the legislative history of Section 301, a grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts over suits by individual employees",2,2,15
2151,This has a sound legislative basis,1,10,15
2152,"because we find consistent references to the flood of litigation which would result, the fact that federal judiciary was then vastly overburdened and still is",2,5,15
2153,And furthermore we find only two references,0,0,15
2154,"At least, I have only been able to find two references to individual employee actions in the entire legislative history of Section 301 and the Taft-Hartley Act",2,2,15
2155,One is -- was referred to my -- by my Brother Harris a question by Representative Barden answered by Representative Hartley,2,3,15
2156,This is the only one of significance,1,10,15
2157,It appears in Lincoln Mills,2,2,15
2158,It doesn't seem to have any particular significance,1,10,15
2159,It's a long question perhaps misunderstood,1,10,15
2160,"The other was a remark by Senator Taft in which he, referring to Section 301 said that it granted rights to the employers and the employees",2,2,15
2161,He obviously misspoke himself,1,9,15
2162,He meant the union not the employees,2,2,15
2163,because he didn't even mentioned a labor organization or the union,2,3,15
2164,Westinghouse established this proposition,1,10,15
2165,Westinghouse is no longer law as to the constitutional questions which bothered Mr,2,5,15
2166,Justice Frankfurter,1,8,15
2167,Lincoln Mills settled that,2,2,15
2168,But if we have Westinghouse in (Inaudible) of history by reason of Lincoln Mills then I failed to see why this Court was so careful to distinguish Westinghouse as it did in Lincoln Mills,2,2,15
2169,And Mr,0,0,15
2170,"Justice Harlan, joining in the occurring opinion made it plain that his concurrence was on the basis that Lincoln Mills involved the enforcement of a collective right and not a uniquely personal right",2,2,15
2171,So that was -- to me at least the status of Westinghouse and how was it -- as it appeared to the lower courts,2,5,15
2172,since,0,0,15
2173,"I have reviewed the lower court decisions and of our ten circuits plus the District of Columbia, there have been -- this question has been raised in nine out of 11, in nine out of 11 cases have followed Westinghouse and said that an individual has no right to sue under Section 301",2,3,15
2174,"This incidentally was a situation in the case heard by this Court at the last terms, Zdanok versus Glidden from the Second Circuit, a suit by individual employees and considered to be without the purview of Section 301",2,2,15
2175,Every court has consistently said in these cases that they were dependent upon diversity and necessary jurisdictional amount,2,5,15
2176,Definitely,2,5,15
2177,"As a matter of fact, I think Mr",0,0,15
2178,Justice Stewart that was the case in Dowd Box,2,2,15
2179,"I think that the Massachusetts law required --
-- the individuals sue on behalf of the union --
-- under their local procedures",2,3,15
2180,"Well, contrary definitely a state procedure could not block enforcement of 301 rights",2,5,15
2181,"Yes, I am, and I'm talking about the reaction of the lower courts, federal courts that have treated the question",2,5,15
2182,since Westinghouse,0,0,15
2183,"Well, we have -- we have four cases decided May and June of this year",2,2,15
2184,There was Detroit Edison versus Palno,2,2,15
2185,"I think that is cited in the brief of the Solicitor, Mr",2,2,15
2186,Justice Stewart,1,12,15
2187,"There's another Sixth Circuit case which I'm sure is cited in my brief, General Drivers Union versus Riss, there -- those were both Sixth Circuit cases",2,2,15
2188,We also have the case of Sheppard versus Cornelia -- Cornelius in the Fifth Circuit,2,2,15
2189,I believe so sir and that was decided in 302 F,1,12,15
2190,2d,0,0,15
2191,"I think its June, May or June of this year",1,8,15
2192,"So that as a matter of fact, many of these Courts of Appeal seem to have some little difficulty with a question that they decide the case is per curiam",2,2,15
2193,"I mean there's no extended consideration --
(Inaudible) -- I choose -- think it was a simple matter and maybe --",0,0,15
2194,but at least the Sixth Circuit has done it per curiam and perhaps,0,0,15
2195,because of the difficulty,2,5,15
2196,In any event that's been the status of the matter in the local courts so that I can't conclude the Dowd Box or rather the Westinghouse has yet in the dustbin of history,2,5,15
2197,Now we come to Dowd back -- Box and that puts it in the dustbin of history,2,5,15
2198,That puts it in the dustbin of history only if Dowd Box involved uniquely personal rights alone which it didn't,2,5,15
2199,It did at the end,1,12,15
2200,because the other questions have become moot as I recall it,2,5,15
2201,"But as initiated in the Massachusetts Court, it was a collective right that the union claimed to enforce just as much as the right to arbitrate",2,2,15
2202,"And of course, in Lincoln Mills we wound up with an arbitration concerning back pay",2,5,15
2203,But the assertion of the federal right which Congress found a desirable method in which Lincoln Mills decided was a right considered by Congress within the meaning of Section 301 and equally with Dowd Box,2,2,15
2204,"Now coming to Atkinson, I must confess at more difficulty with Atkinson for the simple reason that it's premised on two grounds",1,8,15
2205,I think that the majority through Mr,1,8,15
2206,Justice White in discussing count 2 of Atkinson where the jurisdiction was based on diversity said it was sufficient if the complaint on its face showed an alleged violation of a collective bargaining agreement,2,5,15
2207,But Mr,0,0,15
2208,Justice White then went on to consider the second ground,1,10,15
2209,And the second ground involves the only substantive law to be found in Section 301 in its entirety,1,10,15
2210,"And that is the vicarious responsibility of the union and the exculpation of the union member from liability to the -- end that, there would be no repetition of the Danbury Hatter situation",2,2,15
2211,Congress was unanimous in this view both majority and minority,1,10,15
2212,They wanted to end any possibility of a union member being liable,2,3,15
2213,"And in Atkinson, count 2, as Mr",0,0,15
2214,Justice White's opinion states charged these members with liability for breach of the no-strike clause even though they were acting as agents of the union,2,5,15
2215,And to us at least this is controlled by Section 301 (b) in a substantive law there,2,2,15
2216,We were there involved with the suit against the union member individually,2,3,15
2217,"Here, we are considering a suit by an individual member which we think is considerably difficult",1,8,15
2218,"According to my theory, Mr",0,0,15
2219,"Justice White, which I think Professors -- Professor Cox went -- subscribed to, there is a uniquely personal right involved for the individual suits for back pay",2,2,15
2220,"After all he earned it, it's his, the title to it is his, the union has no interest in it",2,5,15
2221,"He is the only that can assert --
In that case, we say that pre-emption should apply firstly",2,2,15
2222,"Then we have what the Solicitor General terms or has termed in a Law Review Article, a provision with a dual aspect",2,2,15
2223,because the union has an interest in it,2,5,15
2224,but so does the individual,0,0,15
2225,"But I submit to the Court that if the union were to sue, its cause of action would be entirely different except as to the issue perhaps of discrimination",2,5,15
2226,"Because the union, I would assume, would be claiming that it was damaged",2,5,15
2227,"because its membership was in fact discouraged, it lost dues, etcetera",2,5,15
2228,"Well, anyone as I understand it can file a charge before the Board and so the union could",2,2,15
2229,But the Board would be considering the Section 7 and 8 rights of the employees,1,10,15
2230,"Yes,",0,0,15
2231,but I say totally different,0,0,15
2232,I certainly do,1,12,15
2233,"because I think when back pay is involved as there was in Westinghouse, it doesn't make much difference what caused the contract is involved",1,10,15
2234,This is an accrued right,1,10,15
2235,"This is now several years old, closed, the wages are -- the right to the wages, if there is one, are vested and they're in the employed",2,2,15
2236,The lower courts at least have so observed,2,2,15
2237,But I'm most frank to admit that it does have a dual aspect,1,9,15
2238,"Now, I would also like to mention that Congress as I think many have observed considered only collective rights and for that matter, as Lincoln Mills -- the briefs in Lincoln Mills may claim, the main thing that they consider was the no-strike clause",2,2,15
2239,And they also considered arbitration rights,2,2,15
2240,"In considering the breach of contract, is an unfair labor practice",2,5,15
2241,They considered these collective rights,2,5,15
2242,They -- at no point except these two references that I have noted referred to individual rights,2,2,15
2243,"And in fact, the contrary it was noted I think by Secretary Schwanbach (ph) testifying before the Committee that individuals had always been able to sue and of course, Congress at that point was concerned with the suability of unions as an entity",2,2,15
2244,This was a problem with them,1,10,15
2245,"There was of course no problem with the suit by an individual, nor has there ever been to my knowledge in the state such a problem on one theory or another, be a third party beneficiary what have you traditionally",2,2,15
2246,Individual rights have been enforceable whether it's for seniority or what have you,2,5,15
2247,"So that there was no necessity felt, I would assume by Congress for dealing with these rights or trying to affect these rights",2,5,15
2248,"Instead they left as they said, the House Conference Report said in rejecting the Senate amendment on breach of contract as an unfair labor practice, we leave this to the usual processes of the law",2,5,15
2249,"Well, these processes become -- I submit respectfully quite unusual if petitioner's argument is acceptable",2,5,15
2250,because they're going to have displaced,2,2,15
2251,In Michigan I know our entire substantive body of law developed over 40 or 50 years in the sense that it will only exist if it is compatible with this so-called federal common law,2,2,15
2252,"So that we do have a problem in federalism, we lack any clear intent from the congressional history or the legislation indicating that Congress intended to usurp the States in the exercise of these rights",2,5,15
2253,And I become frankly quite lost in this area in many respects,1,8,15
2254,"Because normally, I think of legislation, federal legislation as creating rights in the sense of a statute to which you can look",2,2,15
2255,This is not so here,1,9,15
2256,We do know,2,5,15
2257,"however that the federal rights created under Section 301 which we construed to be the right of the union or the employer to sue for breach of agreement, does give the Court's power to fashion a federal law",2,5,15
2258,But we say that it is -- that the scope of this law is limited to the jurisdictional scope of Section 301,2,5,15
2259,because that's where the federal laws came from so to speak from these federal rights,2,5,15
2260,"And to indicate why we feel difficulty in this area, we compare New York Central versus Winfield with the situation here",1,8,15
2261,That case involved the reach of the Federal Employers Liability Act,2,2,15
2262,"And in that case, Congress directed the code of regulation though it's comprehensive and it was based on negligence",2,5,15
2263,The New York legislature passed the Workmen's Compensation Act which did not require a showing of negligence,2,2,15
2264,"And in that case, the question was whether or not a railroad employee could sue under the employer's lia -- could sue or recover under the Workmen's Compensation Act being covered by the Employer's Liability Act",2,5,15
2265,The answer of the Court was no,1,10,15
2266,but when you look at the legislative history of the Federal Employer's Liability Act as Mr,0,0,15
2267,"Justice Bender said, you find that the legislator -- legislature that Congress considered this very point and rejected the idea of imposing liability without negligence",2,5,15
2268,And even then Mr,0,0,15
2269,Justice Brandeis despite this legislative history would have permitted the New York courts to apply the Workmen's Compensation Law,2,5,15
2270,because it was not in conflict,2,5,15
2271,"Here, by virtue of this federal law, common law, the breadth of which we do not know and have no idea of, we have now displaced all law in the area of collective bargaining agreements and industries affecting commerce",2,2,15
2272,"And they maybe utilized, that is the state decisions maybe utilized only as they are consistent with federal decisions so",2,2,15
2273,"As a practitioner, we are left without guidelines or means of determining what law applies",2,2,15
2274,That is exactly petitioner's position as to the reach of the law,1,10,15
2275,"On the contrary on the Railway Labor Act which some people have said as a state -- within the state and subject to the breath of legislation contained in the Railway Labor Act, this Court didn't reach this conclusion",2,2,15
2276,because in Moore and Kopel,0,0,15
2277,"The cases where the employees were discharged what law applied there?
It was state law said this Court",2,2,15
2278,In the case of Moore it was a state statute limitation and in Kopel it was the state rule regarding exhaustion of internal remedies,2,2,15
2279,And I submit that the Railway Labor Act proposes this comprehensive regulation as does the National Labor Relations Act with regard to collective agreements,2,2,15
2280,And going through the entire history of -- not the entire history,2,5,15
2281,"but many of the cases which have considered whether or not state law applies under various (Inaudible) types of federal legislation, I found no instance where the Court has displaced state law unless there is a comprehensive regulation and a probability of conflict not just a possibility of conflict",0,0,15
2282,"So we submit to the Court that whether this be an action based on Section 301 or not and whether or not the federal substantive law applies that nonetheless if there's to be centralized coherent administration of the Act and not duplicate remedies, forum shopping and the like that this Court will following -- the reasoning of other situations require an individual employer to resort the Board first and the Court to defer to the Board where its expertise and knowledge is evaluated in this situation",2,2,15
2283,And we will ask -- we respectfully suggest that this is the best remedy for obtaining centralized administration of Title 1 of the Act,0,0,15
2284,"We also -- and if this would be so if we are right in this contention, then there's no necessity for considering the reach of federal law under Section 301",0,0,15
2285,"On the other hand, if in the Court's opinion pre-emption does not apply in a Section 301 action, then the reach of Section 301 becomes important",1,10,15
2286,"because as my Brother Harris agrees I believe, if substantive law does not control, that is federal substantive law does not control this action then pre-emption does apply even though it is a contract action",1,10,15
2287,Thank you,0,0,15
2288,Mr,0,0,16
2289,"Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court, although both the Commission and Conti in their briefs tried to craft a single sentence to frame the issue in this case, there really are three basic issued presented by this case: Number One, did Congress intend that the Commission have jurisdiction over common law counterclaims; Number Two, may Congress provide for non-Article III dispute resolution where the parties consent to such resolutions; and Number Three, was there consent here?
I believe that the Deputy Solicitor General has adequately covered the ground on the first and third of these issues, and I would like to only add one or two small footnotes",0,0,16
2290,"It is the second issue, whether or not Congress may provide for non-Article III dispute resolution with the consent of the parties, which I think is the real meat of this case, and which I would like to address most of my remarks to",1,10,16
2291,"Going back for just a moment to the first issue of Congress's intent in this case, I think it is significant to point out that this is not a case in which Congress has ratified by an off chance remark in one or two pages out of thousands of pages of legislative history",1,8,16
2292,"Rather, in the 1982 reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, both the Senate and the House used identical language which was cited in all of the briefs,",2,2,16
2293,but it might get lost in the fact that we cited only one set of language,2,2,16
2294,because we didn't want to cite twice,2,5,16
2295,"Both the House and the Senate said that the reparations program seeks to pass upon the entire controversy, including counterclaims which arise out of the same transaction",2,5,16
2296,"It is also significant that both the Senate and the House versions of the bill were reported to give the Commission broad authority, and in fact the House report talked about the fact that the House wanted to exempt the Commission from the usual application of the Administrative Procedures Act, again, to give it broad authority in this case",2,2,16
2297,"Turning quickly to the third issue in this case, whether there was consent here, we believe that this is a relatively easy question",1,10,16
2298,Schor did not simply consent to adjudication by a non-Article III body,2,2,16
2299,He demanded it,2,3,16
2300,He demanded that Conti dismiss its federal action,2,3,16
2301,"The federal judge in that case declined to accede to that demand,",2,5,16
2302,but Conti voluntarily dismissed upon Schor's representation,0,0,16
2303,He only raised this issue after the Administrative Law Judge had announced his preliminary findings and directed Conti to prepare a proposed order,2,3,16
2304,"Turning then to--
--In the federal sense, Your Honor?
No, Justice White",0,0,16
2305,"In the Commission, Conti had the option of ignoring reparations or its counterclaim and going directly to federal court or filing it on a voluntary basis,",2,5,16
2306,"but obviously the goal that was fostered by the--
--Absolutely",0,0,16
2307,He brings a reparations action to seek redress,2,2,16
2308,"Exactly, and Schor knew that",0,0,16
2309,"At the time that he filed his action in reparations, the Seventh Circuit, which is the circuit in which Conti had filed its federal action, had already held some three or four years earlier that a private right of action existed under the commodity--
--Pardon me?
He could have gone to voluntary arbitration if the parties had agreed",2,2,16
2310,He could have gone to state court at that time,2,5,16
2311,"There has been a recent amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act that creates exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts,",2,2,16
2312,"but at the time that he filed his claim--
--That is right, and in fact he was in court",2,5,16
2313,"That is right, Your Honor",1,12,16
2314,That is right,1,12,16
2315,"He still has his choice of his Article III remedy or his Congressionally created reparations remedy,",2,5,16
2316,"but if he chooses the reparations remedy, he takes as the Arnett case called it, the bitter with the sweet",2,2,16
2317,He takes the implications of the procedure that he has decided to elect,2,2,16
2318,"Well, if he were to go to a federal court now, Your Honor, he would be estopped by res judicata,",2,5,16
2319,"since he is litigating--
--That's right, Your Honor",0,0,16
2320,"Exactly, Your Honor",2,5,16
2321,"There could be, Your Honor",2,5,16
2322,"In this case, this contract is governed by Illinois law",2,2,16
2323,Illinois has a ten-year statute for contract claims,2,2,16
2324,"I would like to turn then to that second issue, can Congress permissibly create a non-Article III remedy with the consent of the parties, add this goes to the question that Justice Rehnquist asked the Deputy Solicitor General",0,0,16
2325,"In fact, it is the issue which drove, we believe, the Court of Appeals to its decision",2,2,16
2326,"It is the issue which drives this case, and that is, may the federal government allocate its resources for the voluntary application of a non-Article III remedy to give litigants an option",2,5,16
2327,"I would like, if I may, Your Honors, to pose a hypothetical",1,10,16
2328,"We know from the Southman case, we know from the pronouncements of various members of this Court that this Court favors arbitration, favors the parties turning to alternate dispute resolution foras",2,2,16
2329,"If Congress were to try to aid that arbitration process and cure one of the evils that now exist in arbitration, this case poses serious risks to that kind of a remedy",2,5,16
2330,"The example that I have in mind is under Triple A arbitration, for example",2,2,16
2331,"That forum, the American Arbitration Association, is a very effective one for private litigants to turn to,",1,10,16
2332,but litigants are often wary of it,2,5,16
2333,because of the unevenness of the arbitration panel,2,5,16
2334,Some arbitrators are lawyers,2,2,16
2335,Some arbitrators are associated with industry and have no legal background,2,5,16
2336,"Some arbitrators, the parties simply don't know who they are",2,2,16
2337,"And indeed, when the Triple A gives lists of arbitrators to the parties that have proposed arbitration, the parties are free to strike all of the names, and in that instance the Triple A will simply appoint someone with the parties having no input whatsoever as to the panel that they will have to resolve their disputes",2,2,16
2338,"Congress could correct that problem by appointing a core of professional full-time qualified federal arbitrators to whom the parties would turn only on a voluntary basis, and yet if the Court of Appeals decision is upheld in this case, Congress could not do that",2,2,16
2339,The Court of Appeals decision would tell Congress that it could not use federal resources to help the citizens of this country resolve their disputes even though the citizens wished to resolve their disputes in a consensual manner,2,5,16
2340,"The Mediation Service, of course, doesn't issue binding orders",1,10,16
2341,"It merely aids the parties in forming their own agreement as to final resolution, so it is a slightly different situation",2,2,16
2342,"There also, of course, are labor arbitrators,",2,2,16
2343,but that deals with a specialized area of federal law,0,0,16
2344,"Here we are talking about state law concepts where the parties voluntarily go to those proceedings, and our position, Your Honor, is that the parties may do that, that Congress could permissibly create a federal corps of arbitrators to hear nothing",2,2,16
2345,but state law claims so long as the parties consented to go that forum,2,5,16
2346,"That, we believe, is the nub of--
--Under the current system, Your Honor?
Justice Brennan, at this point, the judicial review is that after the Commission has entered a binding order, an appeal may be taken as of right to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the district",0,0,16
2347,"for the circuit, rather, in which the reparations proceeding was held",2,2,16
2348,"The same standard, Your Honor, and it is a standard of the substantial weight of the evidence",2,5,16
2349,"It is not strictly a de novo review, nor is it a clearly erroneous standard",1,10,16
2350,It is more a middle standard,1,10,16
2351,The reparations action may be brought in any location in which either the broker or the customer are located,2,2,16
2352,Typically reparations will be filed where the individual customer happens to reside,2,2,16
2353,"In this case, Judge Painter, who was sitting, of course, in Washington, asked the parties, who were a customer who resided in New Jersey and a brokerage firm which was a resident of Chicago, if they would be willing to come to Washington for the hearing",2,2,16
2354,"They both agreed to, and that was the reason that the D",2,2,16
2355,C,0,0,16
2356,circuit had jurisdiction of the appeal,2,2,16
2357,"Your Honors, we believe that it is incumbent in the Constitution that the Constitution is an architecture designed to protect the citizens of this country",2,2,16
2358,"It is not an architecture in and of itself,",1,8,16
2359,"but rather, it is designed to aid the legitimate goals of people who reside in that architecture",1,8,16
2360,We are aware of no right under the Constitution granted to its citizens which cannot be waived by individuals,2,2,16
2361,This is exactly that type of situation,1,10,16
2362,If there was a Article III right for Mr,2,5,16
2363,"Schor in this case, he waived it",2,2,16
2364,"If there is an Article III right of litigants to have their disputes heard in common law controversies in Article III courts, they waive it by going to reparations",2,5,16
2365,We believe it is as simple as that,1,8,16
2366,"We would direct Your Honor's attention to the portion in our brief in which we talk about the fact that Conti's counterclaim in this case should not be affected no matter what the ultimate resolution of the broader issue is,",0,0,16
2367,"but we respectfully suggest, unless the Court has further questions, that the judgment below be vacated",0,0,16
2368,Do they differ Mr,2,2,17
2369,"Ferguson on the -- from the (Voice Overlap) --
Inclusive of the arrangement with the --
Mr",2,5,17
2370,Doub -- Mr,0,0,17
2371,"Doub, I want to come back to a question and I think Mr",0,0,17
2372,Justice Frankfurter asked you of the (Inaudible) of your last argument,2,3,17
2373,If that's a fact and there could be no liability upon the private person in these circumstances,2,5,17
2374,Then I gather under the Tort Claims Act it should be then upon the United States,2,3,17
2375,"And that would then answer the case without going into the question of fire fighter immunity, would it not?
(Voice Overlap) --
Well, if I -- if I understand it, what the Government would like -- would be a statement from this Court that even if a private person might be liable in these circumstances under the laws of the State of Washington, nevertheless that this is a service as regards whose conduct there is an immunity notwithstanding the Tort Claims Act whether that's read in by way of exception or granted upon the Tort Claims Act or otherwise, is that right?
Yes,",0,0,17
2376,"but the --
But the Tort Claims Act in words at least says that there is -- show liability of the United States, if a private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred",0,0,17
2377,"Now, your point is, even if there should be liability upon a private person in this circumstance, nevertheless, we should ride into this so read into it, or find in it somehow an immunity in the case of fire fighters, federal fire fighters",1,10,17
2378,"Well,",0,0,17
2379,"but is that right?
Mr",0,0,17
2380,"Ferguson, may I ask?
Would you comment on Mr",0,0,17
2381,Doub suggested that most of the statutes upon which you rely only one of them I think he said made any provision for civil liability,2,3,17
2382,"Most of them as an example in the case of 2523, provide a sanction of criminal sanction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor",2,5,17
2383,"And I gather this argument was that in that circumstance, these statutes are not really available to you",1,10,17
2384,"In other words, these two established standard of care --
-- even though they make their own provision for a criminal responsibility and such?",2,5,17
2385,Mr,0,0,18
2386,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court",2,5,18
2387,I speak for petition of The Boeing Company,2,3,18
2388,This case is here by writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review a 6-3 en banc decision of that court dealing with what it said it regarded as having unusual significance for the conduct of class action litigation,2,2,18
2389,"Specifically, whether attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully prosecute a Federal class action for money damages are entitled to look for their compensation to the total amount for which a defendant would be liable if all class members perfected their claims by filing proofs of claims or only from the amounts payable to those class members who do file proofs of claim and",2,2,18
2390,thus receive the benefits of the legal services rendered by the plaintiffs' attorneys,2,2,18
2391,The Court of Appeals decision here under review held that the plaintiffs' attorneys were entitled to be paid not only from money actually claimed by their client class members,2,2,18
2392,but also from unclaimed money which that court in an earlier decision in this very case held will never belong to or become the property of any client of these attorneys,2,5,18
2393,"Now, it is the position --
Well, Your Honor, I think you have almost that situation right here",2,5,18
2394,"The brief that is amicus curiaed that has been filed by the Special Master appointed to administer this fund informs the Court that claimant, or rather holders of 128,000 face amount of these debentures have been identified, they have been in touch with and they have declined to file proofs of claim",2,2,18
2395,"No, they have not, Your Honor",2,5,18
2396,But there is no question of their not being reached and told that they could do this,2,2,18
2397,"I think that is an an a fortiori case under those circumstances, if he renounces there is no reason why his share of that recovery should be utilized to pay the attorneys for the class members who have claims, under this Court's decision",2,2,18
2398,"Quite right, Mr",1,12,18
2399,Chief Justice; quite right,1,10,18
2400,"Now, it is our position, or the position of The Boeing Company on this appeal, and it was the position of a panel of the Second Circuit which decided this case prior to the en banc decision, that to allow plaintiffs' attorneys to be compensated for monies that are not claimed is two fundamental errors",2,2,18
2401,"One, that it is requiring claiming class members, or it is entitling claiming class members to benefit from monies to which they are not entitled",2,2,18
2402,"And second, that it would be a direct violation of this Court's holding in the Alyeska Pipeline Company case",0,0,18
2403,because the funds which are not claimed would revert to the defendant in the case and,2,5,18
2404,"therefore if they had skimmed off of them sums to pay the claimants' attorneys, there would be a case of the defendants paying part of the legal expenses of the plaintiffs in violation of this Court's rule in Alyeska that each party should pay its own attorneys' fees",2,2,18
2405,"Now, before proceeding to spell out the detail of that argument I would just take a minute to describe the background of the action against which this question comes to Your Honors",0,0,18
2406,"This action is the consolidation of ten suits which were commenced in 1966 after Boeing, as part of its program to finance the construction of the 747 Boeing aircraft, called for redemption a $30 million convertible debenture issue which it had sold in 1958",2,2,18
2407,"Under the terms of the indenture pursuant to which these securities were issued, the holders had a specified period after a call for redemption within which to convert their debentures to Common Stock",2,2,18
2408,"Otherwise, the holder would be limited in the future to receiving only the face amount of his debenture and not any accrual that might have occurred in the value of the Common Stock at the time of the call",2,5,18
2409,"In this instance on the day when the right to convert expired, March 29, 1966, Boeing Common Stock was selling for a price at which $100 of principal amount of debentures if converted would have been worth $316",2,5,18
2410,"25, or $216",2,5,18
2411,25 more than its face amount,2,3,18
2412,"These convertible debentures were unregistered bearer debentures and after the call for redemption and after the time to convert having expired, 1,544,300 face amount of the 30 million had not been converted",2,5,18
2413,"Boeing, faced with this problem of what it should do about those who had failed to claim, sought the advice of two law firms, whether in fairness to non-converting holders and also in fairness to its own shareholders, many of which had become shareholders by reason of converting in time, sought the advice of two law firms as to what it should do under these circumstances",2,5,18
2414,I emphasize this,1,9,18
2415,because this is no case of fraud or impropriety on behalf of anyone,2,5,18
2416,They were in a dilemma under the circumstances,2,5,18
2417,The two firms advised them that they could not extend the time without violating the provisions of the indenture under which these securities had been issued,2,5,18
2418,And under those circumstances Boeing followed the advice and very shortly along came these ten lawsuits,2,5,18
2419,"They were consolidated in the Southern District of New York and The Boeing Company moved for class action treatment under Rule 23, which the court granted",2,2,18
2420,"Well, the basis of jurisdiction, there were claims made under the Trust Indenture Act and under the Securities Act of 1934",2,2,18
2421,"Well, are you referring to the compensation decision or the original decision under which the District Court dismissed this action on the ground that the indenture had been fully complied with; are you referring to that decision, Your Honor, or are you referring to the compensation decision which is here before the Court?
Well, I think on the first decision, on the merits it is very clear that they went on the Trust Indenture Act and the Federal Securities Act",0,0,18
2422,"On the compensation question which is here, I think they went as a matter of general Federal law",1,10,18
2423,"They did not utilize New York law, although New York law in every respect as we see it is the same as Federal law with regard to this question",2,2,18
2424,"It was not, Your Honor",2,5,18
2425,"Now, the District Court after trial dismissed the complaint here, as I said a moment ago, holding that the indenture had been complied with and that there was no basis for these debenture holders recovering",2,5,18
2426,Appealed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit agreed that the indenture had been complied with,2,5,18
2427,"but concluded that the indenture provisions with regard to notice to these debenture holders did not provide, as they said, ""reasonable notice",0,0,18
2428,"""
And said that these debenture holders were entitled to recover the difference between the $100 and the $316",2,5,18
2429,25,0,0,18
2430,They then sent the case back,2,5,18
2431,That first appeal was known as Van Gemert One,2,2,18
2432,"They sent the case back, the District Court entered a judgment for $3,283,359, which was taking the face amount of the debentures, $1,544,000, and multiplying it by the $216 as to which each of these people were entitled, and said they were entitled to receive that amount of money if claimed",2,3,18
2433,"And that judgment provided specifically that each member of the class who had not redeemed his debenture, upon surrendering it would get $316 per debenture less his share of the attorneys' fees required to collect this judgment",2,5,18
2434,"Now, if that judgment had stayed the way it was we never would be here today",2,5,18
2435,We were satisfied with it as a procedural matter and ready to proceed,2,5,18
2436,"However, the plaintiffs appealed a second time",2,5,18
2437,They were not happy,2,2,18
2438,"And they raised a very important, significant point that is involved in this appeal here at the present time",2,2,18
2439,They argued in the Second Circuit that the people who claimed were entitled not only to their own $216 over the $100 face amount,2,2,18
2440,"but also to any amount that was not their share of any amount that was not claimed by one of their fellow class members, called a fluid class recovery",2,2,18
2441,"And --
You are quite right, Mr",0,0,18
2442,Justice Rehnquist,2,3,18
2443,This was 23 -- I think it is 1 or 2 -- there was no right to opt out,1,10,18
2444,That is quite right,1,12,18
2445,"So they made that argument to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that they were entitled to get not only that $2",2,2,18
2446,16,0,0,18
2447,but whatever -- on top of that whatever anybody else their share did not claim,2,5,18
2448,The Court of Appeals struck that down,2,3,18
2449,"They further struck down a second request which was that even if we can't get something for our pockets with regard to this, we at least ought to get the attorney's fees paid from that unclaimed portion as well",2,5,18
2450,"And the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit three-judge panel held, no, you are not entitled to that",2,5,18
2451,because that itself would be an infringement on our rejection in the Eisen case of the fluid recovery doctrine,2,5,18
2452,"Furthermore, said the court, that would be a violation of the American rule on attorneys' fees as propounded in the Alyeska case",2,2,18
2453,because we would be taking money from -- that might go back to Boeing and using it to pay -- help pay the class members who do claim their attorneys' fees,2,2,18
2454,"So --
Yes",0,0,18
2455,"It certainly is, Your Honor,",0,0,18
2456,but that has not been decided as yet,0,0,18
2457,"We certainly would, Your Honor",1,12,18
2458,"That would certainly be a tremendous problem,",1,10,18
2459,"but we would oppose that vigorously, Your Honor",0,0,18
2460,"Now, when this decision was rendered by the Second Circuit, my brethren here, did they petition for rehearing en banc of that?
No",2,5,18
2461,"Did they petition for review in this Court?
That was the decision",2,5,18
2462,"It went back to the Southern District of New York and lo and behold, the judgment -- this was Van Gemert Two is now out of the way -- the judgment which was proposed to the court followed the same procedure as previously with regard to the $3,280,000 which it claimed these debenture holders would get",2,5,18
2463,But then it went on and said this and it is further ordered that the members of the plaintiffs' committee of attorneys be awarded their fees and expenses and disbursements as fixed by the court to be paid out of said total amount of this judgment,2,3,18
2464,"Now, we regarded this to be in direct violation of what the Second Circuit had done in Van Gemert Two and, moreover, we were astounded",1,10,18
2465,because at that time the plaintiffs' attorneys were asking for $2 million in counsel fees in this action,2,5,18
2466,So for the first time The Boeing Company took an appeal to the Second Circuit,2,2,18
2467,"And when we went up there and argued in that deal before the panel, the panel of three judges agreed with us and said under our prior decision we said there cannot be any respect for the -- or acquiescence in a fluid class recovery and to allow the class members to get something from the non-claimers would be a violation of that",2,5,18
2468,And furthermore it would be a violation of Alyeska,2,5,18
2469,"Petition for rehearing en banc for the first time and we get the decision 6 to 3, which is under review here",1,10,18
2470,"Now, before I proceed to give you very quickly the three reasons we think that decision en banc is wrong, I want to just report very briefly the status of the distribution of this fund at the present time",1,10,18
2471,"On July 8, 1977, just a few days following the decision of Van Gemert Two, Boeing deposited in an escrow account -- not a judgment",2,5,18
2472,"but an escrow account -- as established by the District Court's judgment the $3,289,359 which I have been referring to and $2,459,646 of pre-judgment interest, which combined sum together with other deposits currently accruing interest is today over $7 million",2,5,18
2473,As a result of published notices and two years of beating the drums and the work of this sole Special Master Mr,2,2,18
2474,"Solleder, 46 percent of the fact amount of the debentures unconverted on March 29, '66 have filed claims",2,5,18
2475,"To date the remaining 54 percent of potential claimants have either not been identified or having been located, Mr",2,5,18
2476,"Chief Justice, have to date declined to perfect their judgments",2,5,18
2477,"By amount, Your Honor",2,5,18
2478,"Forty-six percent of the face amount of the debentures which were not converted and 54 percent which were not converted have not claimed, 54 percent",2,5,18
2479,"It is just -- well, I will --
Right",0,0,18
2480,"Well, -- just one moment -- the paragraph, Mr",0,0,18
2481,"Justice Stewart, of the judgment reads, Ordered that within 15 days after the entry of this judgment the defendant shall deposit the amount of this judgment, plus interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum to the date of such deposit in a commercial bank, and so forth, upon which interest shall accumulate until disbursed",0,0,18
2482,And that such money shall be so held in escrow pending the further order of this court,2,5,18
2483,"Then in the final paragraph of the order, the Special Master is given instructions that he shall pass on the validity or invalidity of the claims",2,2,18
2484,"Now, we say that that",0,0,18
2485,therefore leaves the unclaimed funds up to further order of the Court at a later time,2,5,18
2486,"It does, Your Honor; it does speak of a judgment",2,2,18
2487,"But after all, that is the judgment of liability which, as I understand it, in class actions is preliminary to whatever may be done by individual class members",2,2,18
2488,"Now, without repeating here the arguments and the analysis of authorities -- by the way, I would just say that you can see that 46 and 54 percent of $7 million, that the funds that are being dealt with here are not de minimis",0,0,18
2489,"Without repeating our arguments on the brief, there are three principal reasons that we believe the Court of Appeals en banc was in error",1,10,18
2490,"The most egregious error we believe is in the underlying premise which the majority advances to support its stated desire to avoid, and I quote, ""unfairness to claiming class members"" and to permit them to enjoy, and I quote, ""the spoils of victory",1,9,18
2491,"""
Now, the court, which is its right to recognize those elements, by saying that its decision is sustained by longstanding precedent",2,5,18
2492,"Now, the two decisions of this Court which the Court of Appeals rely on are Trustees v",2,5,18
2493,Greenough and Sprague v,0,0,18
2494,Ticonic National Bank,2,2,18
2495,I am sure Mr,1,12,18
2496,"Justice White is familiar with these,",2,5,18
2497,because they are dealt with in the Alyeska case and the very question that was before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was dealt with in that opinion,2,2,18
2498,"No, no",0,0,18
2499,"But the contentions were made -- and I have the briefs here, Your Honor -- that those cases warranted the Court reaching a decision of imposing on the losing party the counsel fees",2,5,18
2500,"And the Court rejected it and explained the corollary to the American rule of attorneys' fees, that those cases embody and limited it",2,2,18
2501,"That corollary is to the effect that where a prevailing litigant has conferred benefits on other parties that can be identified, that those parties before participating in the benefits of the litigation must share their part of the cost of the litigation",1,10,18
2502,This corollary to the American rule on lawyers' fees is founded on the common law principle against unjust enrichment,1,10,18
2503,"In other words, if somebody -- and it is on this very basis that the claimants who come into this case and collect -- the 46 percent who collect -- must obviously pay their share of the attorneys' fees, and with that we have no question",0,0,18
2504,"But that is the principle of those two cases that I just mentioned, Sprague and the Trustees v",0,0,18
2505,Greenough,1,10,18
2506,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in the first place we have had two years when the effort to locate these potential claimants has gone forward, claims have been filed, they have been reviewed",2,5,18
2507,"And as the Special Master reports in his little amicus brief, I think of the claims that have been filed, I am not sure of this,",0,0,18
2508,"but there is about 30,000 which is still under review",0,0,18
2509,"Now, as soon as this question has been decided those will be paid off at once",2,5,18
2510,"And then the District Court has stated it will consider again how much longer it will extend --
That is correct, Your Honor",0,0,18
2511,"Well, no, I think what would be done is that the Court would determine what was a fair attorneys' fees in this situation",1,10,18
2512,"It would then assess against the claiming class holders who came in who are now there with their 46 percent --
-- and assess that against them",2,2,18
2513,"If thereafter someone else comes in and makes a claim, the same percentage as applied to each of the claiming ones previously would apply to the new claimant",2,2,18
2514,And the plaintiffs' attorneys would receive that percentage at that time,2,2,18
2515,"Well, I don't think that is quite right, Your Honor",1,12,18
2516,"I think what the Court will do, it will take that 46 percent and then they will say, what is it that the plaintiffs' attorneys are entitled to here based on their services, the difficulty of the case, etc",2,2,18
2517,"Then that is applied --
Correct",0,0,18
2518,"Yes, they would, Your Honor",2,5,18
2519,"Well, I don't know whether the Court would take that into consideration or not",1,10,18
2520,But the way the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit when it sent this back in Van Gemert Two envisaged this being carried out was that just as I have explained to Your Honor at this time,2,2,18
2521,"And if the plaintiffs' attorneys thereafter, if other people came in and got the benefits of it, then they would owe the plaintiffs' attorneys a fee",2,5,18
2522,And that fee would be measured as it had been measured in the case of those who had previously claimed,2,2,18
2523,"I think as in all of this kind of case that the percentage would certainly be a very important --
Well, unless as Your Honor suggested, I think -- it is hard to say how the District Court will actually do this determination",0,0,18
2524,I think it is fair to say that they will certainly give great weight to the services rendered and then I think they will give weight to the result achieved and thereby bring into effect a percentage which of course would be the same percentage that was ultimately applied the other claims,1,10,18
2525,"Well, Your Honor, I -- there is nothing in the record with regard to this, I would say first",0,0,18
2526,"But from my considerable experience in this type of case where claims are not filed, very often a potential claimant has completed a tax year and does not want to go back and reopen by reason of additional income the entire tax picture, or has made some other arrangement",2,5,18
2527,"I would think they were fairly modest amounts, Your Honor",1,10,18
2528,"But it is $128,000 face amount of the $1,544,000",2,5,18
2529,"Well, now, I see just five minutes and I quickly say there are three specific grounds which we urge --
I would like to reserve two minutes, so I will get this off my chest in three minutes if I may, Your Honor",0,0,18
2530,It is just so if any questions come up I could be able to answer them after the Respondents have completed,2,2,18
2531,"First, we believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals en banc violates the common fund principle of Trustees v",1,10,18
2532,"Greenough, as applied in Alyeska, in the opinion in Alyeska",2,2,18
2533,"Second, we believe that no judgment as far as an individual is concerned comes into being until a claim is filed, so that there is no common fund within the principle of those cases until a claim is filed",2,2,18
2534,"And last, and most important, we believe that any decision which encompasses using some of the unclaimed fund to benefit the claiming members is a clear violation of what is called the fluid class recovery, the rule that if it is a small amount perhaps, it may be fairly large,",1,10,18
2535,"but it is allowing the claiming members, in effect, to benefit from those who do not claim from that fund",2,2,18
2536,"And that has been not only in the Eisen case, in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was that ruled out,",0,0,18
2537,but in this very case it was ruled out,0,0,18
2538,"And for these reasons, Your Honor, we believe that this Court should reverse the en banc decision of the Second Circuit",1,10,18
2539,Thank you very much,0,0,18
2540,"Your Honor, I just have one item that I would like to bring up",1,10,18
2541,"By the way, the District Court specifically reserved decision on the matter of counsel fees until this question was determined by the appellate courts and filed an opinion which is --
It is entirely possible if the --
No, no",0,0,18
2542,"Excuse me, Your Honor, then I haven't understood you",2,5,18
2543,"If we prevail here, then no part of the attorneys' fees will be assessed against the non-claimant fund",2,5,18
2544,Right,1,12,18
2545,Conceivably from each additional claimant,2,5,18
2546,And that is why -- the one point I wanted to respond in this reply is to Mr,0,0,18
2547,Justice Potter's question about the finality of this judgment,1,10,18
2548,"The judgment which is appealed from here first says that the plaintiff shall recover their damages herein from the defendants the principal sum of $3,289,359",2,5,18
2549,"Then it goes on and says, ordered that the members of the plaintiffs' committee be awarded their fees, expenses and disbursements fixed by the court to be paid out of said total amount of this judgment",2,3,18
2550,"Now, we were faced when we saw that judgment with the fact that unless we raised that point now this would be final",2,5,18
2551,"And when the time came in as to where those monies should come from it would be saying, well, you never appealed from this judgment",2,5,18
2552,"But still the determination of where those fees won liability and where those fees should come from was imposed on the total fund which we claim, and still claim, if unclaimed belongs to Boeing",2,5,18
2553,And as to that extent it is final on that issue,1,8,18
2554,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, with due respect on this issue the point -- the clear point that re Loomis, as of this case have to pay part of the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, whatever they may be fixed at, in due respect we believe was final",1,10,18
2555,And if we didn't raise it and bring it up we would then be told we were bound by that determination,2,5,18
2556,"Right or wrong, that was our position",1,9,18
2557,"And it was raised in the Court of Appeals, not en banc,",2,2,18
2558,"but earlier; and the court took the position and decided a res, the panel",0,0,18
2559,Thank you very much,0,0,18
2560,Mr,0,0,19
2561,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court",2,5,19
2562,"In this case we have made several arguments and the alternative, any one of which is in our view sufficient standing alone to warrant an affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals",2,5,19
2563,"In the early part of our brief we explained why we believe that under this Courts analysis in the Iannelli decision, a conspiracy is not a lesser included offense of a continuing criminal enterprise",2,2,19
2564,"Those arguments which are essentially matters of statutory construction are laid out fully in our brief and with the Courts permission, I will move on directly to some of our arguments which are perhaps more conceptually difficult",1,10,19
2565,"In concert with, yes, Mr",2,5,19
2566,"Justice Stewart, we have urged that that statute does not use the language conspiracy, does not use the language of agreement, Congress knew in creating this act how to use those words, it did so in Section 846 and it did so in Section 849, it did not do so in Section 848",2,2,19
2567,"Thats correct, Mr",0,0,19
2568,Justice,1,12,19
2569,"Yes, thats probably correct",1,12,19
2570,"Well, I know of no case that squarely face that issue, there are decisions in the Court of Appeals which have upheld convictions of defendants on both Section 846 conspiracies and Section 848 continuing criminal enterprise convictions charges",2,2,19
2571,He did indeed,1,12,19
2572,"They are unclear, they adopt neither",2,2,19
2573,The first of the remaining arguments that I would like to touch on in our brief is perhaps the narrowest of those arguments and that is that the petitioner having insisted that the charges against him not be tried in one case cannot now complain that they were in keeping with his wishes tried in two trials,2,5,19
2574,If the Court agrees with opposition in this regard then it will be necessary to decide whether a conspiracy is in fact a lesser included offense of a continuing criminal enterprise,1,10,19
2575,"Yes, thats right you can decide this issue even assuming that it is a lesser included offense",1,10,19
2576,The indictment charging petition with the conspiracy and the indictment charging him with the continuing criminal enterprise were returned on the same day by the same grand jury,2,5,19
2577,The government then moved to consolidate those two indictments for trial in one case,2,2,19
2578,Petitioner,2,3,19
2579,"however objected, he argued, I am reading from the Page 15 of the appendix, this is his objection to the governments motion to consolidate, that consolidation of these indictments would be improper in this case for the reason is that neither the parties nor the charges are the same",1,10,19
2580,He said at Page 18 of the appendix that the government was attempting to consolidate a conspiracy of ten defendants with a substantive offense of only one defendant,2,3,19
2581,"He said to add a substantive defense to the conspiracy charge would only confuse the jury, and he concluded on Page 23 of the appendix that consolidation would be wrong",2,3,19
2582,since there is neither an identity of defendants nor an identity of charges in the two indictments,2,2,19
2583,"His arguments of course prevailed, the District Court denied the governments motion and ordered that the indictment to be tried separately as they were",2,2,19
2584,"Prior to trial in the instant case the petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment completely reversing his position and now arguing that the government was at fault for not joining all the charges against him in one case, this is at Page 29 of the appendix",2,3,19
2585,"Petitioner also argued that once the District Court had exceeded to his request that the indictments to be tried in two trials, then the government was obliged, petitioner said, by the double jeopardy clause to elect which indictment it would bring to trial against him and to forego prosecution on the other",2,5,19
2586,That motion of course was not granted,2,2,19
2587,"In his reply brief for the first time in this case, petitioner now takes he had a third position",2,5,19
2588,He argues that his objection to the governments motion to consolidate has been misinterpreted all this time,1,10,19
2589,He says at Page 5 of his reply brief that he was objecting not to trial of both charges together in a single trial,2,3,19
2590,but to the presence of the other conspiracy defendants in the same case with him,0,0,19
2591,The suggestion in short is that the petitioner actually wanted all of the charges brought against him in a single case involving him alone,1,10,19
2592,The record slightly refutes this,1,10,19
2593,"It is true that in the objection, in his objection to the governments motion to consolidate, the petitioner said that he feared that the evidence of a word X of his co-conspirators which would be admissible against him in the conspiracy case would carry over and prejudice him in the jurys mind on the continuing criminal enterprise charge",2,5,19
2594,"But the remedy said petitioner, was to try the charges separately, not to try him alone free of all the other defendants, indeed if the charges had been tried separately that very same evidence would have been admissible",2,5,19
2595,The evidence of his co-conspirators of word X whether or not they were named as co-defendants in a case charging him with both conspiracy and a continuing criminal enterprise,2,5,19
2596,Furthermore the docket entries in the two cases show that petitioner never wanted both charges tried together,2,5,19
2597,"The indictments were returned on March 18, trial on the conspiracy charge was set first for May 20, trial on the continuing criminal enterprise charge was set for June 24",2,2,19
2598,"In early April the government moved to consolidate, on April 29, petitioner filed his objections to that motion and the hearing was held on April 30, that hearing was inconclusive, it was continued over to May 7, and between that first half -- the first part of that hearing on May 30, and the second on May 7, the petitioner moved to postpone the continuing criminal enterprise from its initial date of June 24 over to August 12, that motion was granted, that was not we submit the action of one who wanted to go to trial on both charges in a single case",2,2,19
2599,"Well, we think that the petitioner stands in the same relation to the double jeopardy clause as does a defendant who secures in the middle of his trial, a mistrial or who consents to a mistrial",1,10,19
2600,"Indeed we think the petitioner stands roughly in the same posture vis-à-vis the double jeopardy clause, as the defendant who appeals his conviction to get a new trial",1,10,19
2601,"Now, the reason that a new trial is permitted now withstanding the jeopardy is already attached",2,5,19
2602,"Whenever a defendant requests a mistrial or consents to one…
No, it is not important the jeopardy attached, what is important is that the petitioner retain primary control over the course to be followed",2,5,19
2603,That is the reason why for example when a case has already started before the jury and the defendant requests a mistrial he can be tried again,2,5,19
2604,"This Court has explained that result not so much in terms of waiver which the Court has held that traditional waiver concepts are not particularly relevant under double jeopardy analysis, what is important is that, the defendant in this case the petitioner retains primary control over the course to be followed",2,2,19
2605,"In this case that happened, the government wanted one trial, petitioner wanted two, he retained primary control",2,5,19
2606,"Well, there were two trials that were scheduled, one for May and one for June",2,2,19
2607,The government moved to consolidate them; the petitioner opposed that consolidation that is pretty close to saying he wanted two trials that seems to me,2,2,19
2608,"He wanted the status quo maintained, that was two trials",2,2,19
2609,"Well, I do not use either of those labels",1,10,19
2610,"Yes, I think that the established legal doctrine that permits for example, a retrial after defendant requests a mistrial",2,5,19
2611,"Well, this Court has declined to call it a waiver or an estoppel although the concepts are quite similar",2,2,19
2612,"The word “waiver” connotes for example the Johnson against Zerbst standard and the Court has consistently refused to adopt that standard in cases involving a double jeopardy clause,",2,5,19
2613,but I think the result and the concept is essentially the same,0,0,19
2614,The defendant got what he wanted,2,2,19
2615,"For him now to say that he is immunized from prosecution on the second charge, when the government wanted to go forward with both charges together in one trial perhaps that can be said to have stopped him or that he waived in any event his control over the proceedings now disables him from claiming protection by the double jeopardy clause",2,5,19
2616,"Well, he was going to go to two trials",2,5,19
2617,"Well, he pleaded not guilty and he would have preferred to have no trials,",2,5,19
2618,but that certainly is not a protection granted by the Double Jeopardy Clause,0,0,19
2619,We are not punishing him; we are trying to avoid the governments being punished with the District Courts granting his motion to try these cases separately when the government wanted to try them together,2,2,19
2620,"If we had not moved to consolidate would he be in the same position he is in now?
No, I do not think so",0,0,19
2621,He insisted though on two trials,1,10,19
2622,"Well, the government could have returned these two charges against the petitioner in a two count indictment presumably and presumably at that point, the petitioner would have moved to sever the counts and presumably the District Court would have been persuaded by his arguments",2,5,19
2623,Thats exactly right,1,12,19
2624,"No, we made the motion for one trial, we tried to bring these two counts, these charges against him in a single trial, the only reason they have resulted in two trials was",2,5,19
2625,because the petitioner insisted that they take place in two trials,2,5,19
2626,I am not sure I understand your question Mr,1,10,19
2627,Justice,1,12,19
2628,"Well, I think that is his argument that is his argument",1,8,19
2629,"Well, we do not think the government was prohibited from going to trial on the continuing criminal enterprise, even assuming into greater offence",1,10,19
2630,He was tried for the conspiracy first,2,3,19
2631,Thats correct,1,12,19
2632,"Well, the government thought to bring those cases, tried to bring them jointed",2,5,19
2633,"The government has never taken the position that they are lesser and greater included offences, they are trying to bring them together",1,10,19
2634,"Now, let us assume they are greater unless they are offences then the result of the petitioner's argument is that whenever a defendant is charged with an offence that can be broken down on a lesser included offence and can persuade the District Court to order the government to try the lesser included offence separately from the grader and the lesser included offence first then he is there after immunized from prosecution on the greater offence",2,2,19
2635,We submit that,0,0,19
2636,I do not know why he would have -- I do not why Speedy Trial considerations -- no I think Speedy Trial considerations would militate in favor of both charges being tried in the single trial together rather than separating them,2,2,19
2637,"Well, I think if there were substantial lapse of time in the two indictments even in that case to try both charges together would bring both charges to trial and to combination at the soonest moment possible",1,10,19
2638,"The record does not show that,",0,0,19
2639,but I think that we can make some inferences from the record,0,0,19
2640,The conspiracy trial was set first for May 20th and the continuing criminal enterprise for June 24th,2,2,19
2641,"On May 7th when the District Court refused to grant the governments motion to consolidate,",2,2,19
2642,but that time the continuing criminal enterprise charge have been pushed off to August 12th,2,2,19
2643,"Now, by that time also there were some 75 docket entries in the conspiracy case involving ten defendants, involving all of those defendants",2,2,19
2644,Substantial pretrial activity had already taken place and that trial was always scheduled to go first and it involved ten defendants that made sense for it to go first,2,5,19
2645,"No, and in fact if the defendant wanted to have a lesser included offence and a greater offence tried separately in most cases it would make sense to try the lesser first,",2,2,19
2646,"because if you try the greater first that would by definition include trial of the lesser, unless the jury got some sort of special instruction",2,2,19
2647,"Well, I was saying that petitioner's action in this case, puts him in the same positions as one who request the mistrial --
I would say the Double Jeopardy Clause would not prohibit successive trials as long as the defendant was never twice in jeopardy on the same offence",2,5,19
2648,He would have the protection of the due process clause if it appeared that successive prosecutions by the government were for no good reasons out to harass the defendant something along that line,2,5,19
2649,Oh yes,1,12,19
2650,"Oh well, I certainly did not mean it to be, and the trial, in the example that you put, at the trial on I think you said men slaughter",2,5,19
2651,It would be in these circumstances at the trial for men slaughter the defendant was not in jeopardy of conviction or punishment on the first degree murder charge,2,5,19
2652,"Right, and the trial in the first degree murder charge, the defendant could not be allowed to be placed in jeopardy for conviction of the lesser included offense of men slaughter and if you were convicted on the greater any punishment that he had received on the lesser, would have to be given credit",2,5,19
2653,This I think is the Diaz case,1,8,19
2654,"Yes, I understand, I think that the Diaz case stands for the broader preposition and in the narrow effects in which it was decided",1,8,19
2655,"Yes, provided that, yes it could be tried on the indictment for first degree murder",2,5,19
2656,"Yes, you will have to avoid a couple of punishment",2,5,19
2657,"I do not know the answer to that, I think it would be hard to give him any credit there",1,10,19
2658,I do say that the Due Process Clause would protect the defendant against vexatious prosecution,2,5,19
2659,I think probably the Due Process Clause would prohibit that series of prosecution,1,10,19
2660,Not so long as he has never twice placed in jeopardy on the same offence,2,5,19
2661,"No, I think those are not the same offences under the Blockburger test, I think that prosecution will be perfectly permissible, I think the situation you just hypothesized does not involve greater and lesser included offence",1,10,19
2662,"That is correct it does not, it is ---
It is a formula for identifying the identity of offences",2,5,19
2663,"Well, I said a moment ago that I thought that the Diaz case stands for the broad proposition than I have just advanced, at the very least I submit, it stands for the narrower preposition that prosecution on the greater offence can be had following conviction on a lesser included offence",1,10,19
2664,"Whenever at the time of the trial of the lesser included offence the government for good reason, was not able to charge the greater offence",2,5,19
2665,"Thus for example, if the greater crime, has not yet actually been committed when the lesser is tried as in the Diaz case or for example if the defendant can conceal the full extend of his crime from the government so that the government does not know the greater offence has been committed when the lesser is tried or as in the present case, if the government is prohibited by order of court from trying both cases together, then we submit the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar prosecution for the greater offence, provided of course that there was a conviction on the lesser included offence and provided that any punishment that he has suffered from the lesser offence be credited",2,2,19
2666,"No it was not,",0,0,19
2667,but,0,0,19
2668,"since the government do not believe it was a greater offence of being that --
No, it certainly was not, the defendant had argued quite strongly different cases",2,5,19
2669,"No,",0,0,19
2670,but we continue to believe that they are not greater or lesser included offence,0,0,19
2671,"Well, let us assume that we knew that there was an issue, it would still make sense to try the less and first I submit especially",2,5,19
2672,since the lesser offence involved ten defendants,2,2,19
2673,But there was no issue raised about which trial would go first,1,10,19
2674,The conspiracy was always set to go first,1,10,19
2675,"Furthermore, when the District Court ruled that the cases that could not be consolidated, it had already ruled against us and the cases were even bore such a close resemblance to each other that they were appropriate for consolidation",2,5,19
2676,"Well, that is right that is right",1,12,19
2677,That is correct,1,12,19
2678,"Opposition I think fully respects the policies that underlie the Double Jeopardy Clause, two prosecutions in the situation such as I have just described, do not represent judge shopping by the prosecution, in order to secure sentence that the government seeks -- that appears to be appropriate from the point of view of the government alone, nor do they represent an effort by the government to try a defendant repeatedly until the conviction has obtained, contradicting earlier acquitals and perhaps casting doubt on the integrity of earlier trials",2,5,19
2679,"It is true that the defendant may live in a continuing state of anxiety that he will someday be tried for the greater offence,",1,10,19
2680,"but if the defendant is concealed the full extend of this crime, or if as here he himself requests two trials that anxiety cannot be said to have been caused by any misconduct on the part of the government",2,5,19
2681,"As I mentioned earlier our position does not leave a defendant at the mercy of a prosecutor who would carve up in offence into a series of underlying offences and bring a series of vexatious prosecutions, up the ladders it is said",2,2,19
2682,The Due Process Clause fully protects the defendant from such governmental conduct even if,1,10,19
2683,"because he is never twice put in jeopardy, he cannot claim protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause",2,5,19
2684,Yes,1,12,19
2685,That is correct Mr,1,12,19
2686,Justice,1,12,19
2687,"Yes, that is correct",1,12,19
2688,"If they had put both counts in the same indictment, yes I think he could have moved to sabre the counts",1,10,19
2689,"Yes, I think I would presume that he would have, I presume these objections to going to trial and both of those charges together would have been the same",1,10,19
2690,So we would come out the same,1,10,19
2691,"Indeed, for example suppose the District Court had granted our order and it had gone up to the Court of Appeals and the petitioner in the Court of Appeals had argued that that notion to consolidate had been improperly granted by the District court and the appellate court accepted this position and sent it back for a new trial, a separate trial in the continuing criminal enterprise",2,5,19
2692,I think the defendant would be hard put to say that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred that trial,1,10,19
2693,"I think he is in the same position, as he would have been in persuading the Court of Appeals to order two trials as he is today having persuaded the District Court to order two trials",1,10,19
2694,"Well, he said that he feared that the evidence of his co-conspirators' overt Acts would come in and that would carry over,",2,5,19
2695,but that evidence would be admissible,0,0,19
2696,"If he was tried in one trial on both the conspiracy and the continuing criminal enterprise, the evidence of his co-conspirators' overt acts would be admissible against him on the conspiracy charge, even if they were not named as co-defendants that requires an instruction by the District Court to the jury that they should not consider the evidence of overt acts on the continuing criminal enterprise charge",2,5,19
2697,"Now, the petitioner argues that our position is foreclosed by this courts decisions in Waller against Florida and Robinson against Neil",2,5,19
2698,"Those cases in our view, do not hold the prosecution for greater offence is always barred by an earlier conviction on a lesser included offence",1,10,19
2699,Indeed that issue was not raised or argued in those cases,2,2,19
2700,"They involved the question whether a municipality and the state with dual sovereigns under the Double Jeopardy Clause and holding that they were not, the court cannot be said to have passed upon or resolve the questions presented here",2,2,19
2701,"If those questions had been presented and passed, if those questions had been resolved in Waller or in Robinson, then presumably the court could have decided Blackledge against Perry on double jeopardy grounds, and presumably the court or perhaps the court would not have granted a writ of certiorari and the case to be argued next Brown against Ohio",2,5,19
2702,"I think that the issue was an open one, I think this is the first time it is presented to the court and I would repeat enclosing that the Due Process Clause is available to prevent the prosecutor from carving up crimes and bringing a series of prosecutions for no good reason",1,10,19
2703,The Double Jeopardy Clause,2,2,19
2704,however applies only when a defendant is twice put in jeopardy for the same offence,1,10,19

2720,As he was directing that to the period when you were on leave free from military discipline and free from any obligation to report,2,5,20
2721,But he wasnt questioning the military duty as a basis for the writ,2,5,20

2729,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court",2,5,22
2730,Fre Le Poole Griffiths was born in the Netherlands in 1940,2,3,22
2731,Immigrated to this country on a temporary visa in 1965,2,3,22
2732,Obtained the status of a permanent resident alien after she acquired work in this country in the State of New York in 1965,2,5,22
2733,"She continued to work in this country and was married in 1967, and moved to Washington, D",2,4,22
2734,C,0,0,22
2735,"After residing in Washington, D",2,2,22
2736,C,0,0,22
2737,"approximately two years, she moved to New Haven, Connecticut where she was admitted to Yale Law School as a second year law student",2,2,22
2738,She completed her studies for an LLB degree at Yale Law School and graduated from Yale Law School in June of 1969,2,3,22
2739,"She has the equivalent of a BA in Law from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and LLB in Law from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and an LLB in Law from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut",2,2,22
2740,"She is concededly, in all respects, qualified for admission to the Bar examination in the State of Connecticut",2,2,22
2741,"But for the fact that Rule 8 (1) of the Superior Court rules of the State of Connecticut requires that all applicants for admission to the Bar examination, be citizens of the United States",2,2,22
2742,Fre Griffiths is not a citizen of United States and did not at the time for application intend to become a citizen of the United States,2,3,22
2743,"She was at the time of her application, a resident within the residency requirements of the State of Connecticut for admission to the Bar",2,3,22
2744,This was the fourth hearing that weve attended and youre the first person to ask,2,2,22
2745,The record does not so indicate why she does not intend to become a citizen of the United States,2,2,22
2746,"If you like for me to give you the reason, I would --
The record does not show whether she intends to remain in the United States or in the State of Connecticut",2,5,22
2747,She was not asked that question,1,10,22
2748,"She in fact, does intend to reside in the United States as with her husband",2,2,22
2749,Yes and she does intend to reside in the United States indefinitely,2,3,22
2750,She does not at this time intend to become a citizen,2,3,22
2751,Her feeling is that after 25 years of living in Holland that she cannot give that up at this particular time,1,9,22
2752,Dual citizenship is not a possibility,1,10,22
2753,"It would be as if we immigrated to Holland, say we married a Dutch citizen and I was living in Holland and my wife was working there, and in order to practice my profession as a lawyer, I was required to give up my citizenship in the United States",2,3,22
2754,My failure to do that and I would not give up my citizenship in the United States to be a Dutch citizen would not be,2,5,22
2755,"because of any lack of loyalty to Holland, where Im resident thereof or",2,5,22
2756,because I intended to violate any laws of Holland or,2,3,22
2757,because I could not abide by the constitutional laws of Holland,2,5,22
2758,It will be,2,2,22
2759,because of the feeling that I have after having my family and resided in the United States for 25 years,2,5,22
2760,That sort of personal feeling is what Mrs,2,5,22
2761,Griffiths has and she doesnt feel (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2762,"No there are contingencies (Voice Overlap)
I think it is not what Connecticut is trying to get at",1,8,22
2763,"Connecticut -- people have personal feelings, for example, with regards to their citizenship in the State in the United States, by the virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have a dual citizenship to a State and to the United States if we are a citizens (Voice Overlap)",2,2,22
2764,Thats correct,1,12,22
2765,"Well, to contingency -- if youre asking, is there a contingency that she might go back to Holland",2,5,22
2766,"That contingency, in fact, exists as much as the contingency that someone born in California, who is admitted to practice law in Connecticut, might go back to California, that someone whos a citizen of the United States might choose to re-announce their United States citizenship and move to Israel",2,2,22
2767,"That someone might die, that someone might commit a breach to the Canons of Ethics as a member of the Bar and be disqualified",2,5,22
2768,There are all sorts of disabling contingencies that one can have and certainly one of them would be that she can go to Holland,2,2,22
2769,"Thats a contingency that her husband also is subject to, that anyone would be subject to in leaving United States",2,2,22
2770,I do not think it is what the State of Connecticut is getting at by requiring United States citizenship of all members or applicants to the Bar though,1,9,22
2771,"No, I would not have a right to be a judge in Holland though it is interesting that my client, who is not a citizen to United States, and is a citizen of Holland, would on our research, have a right to be the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court",2,2,22
2772,Our research tells me that in Holland that is not the case,2,2,22
2773,Im telling you what my client tells me about Dutch law,2,3,22
2774,I dont purport to know anything about it other than that,2,5,22
2775,We have not found any disabling provisions for an alien to be a United States District Court Judge or to be on the Supreme Court of the United States of America,2,2,22
2776,Theres no requirement that a Justice on the Supreme Court be a lawyer,2,2,22
2777,"According to my client, I could not",2,5,22
2778,Without being a Dutch citizen,2,3,22
2779,Our research shows that there are very few countries that allow what one would call reciprocity without the requirement of citizenship,2,2,22
2780,"One of the few being Japan, and it is apparently possible in England,",2,2,22
2781,but it is not possible according to her in Holland,0,0,22
2782,She is presently living in Holland and is coming back Thursday and has the intention of practicing in Connecticut if this opinion is favorable to her,2,7,22
2783,She went to Holland and have a child,2,3,22
2784,"She now has,",0,0,22
2785,since the beginning of this lawsuit has had two children,2,3,22
2786,No it is not Your Honor,1,8,22
2787,There is no residency requirement in the State of Connecticut,2,2,22
2788,Rule 8 (2) requires that you have an intention to reside in the State of Connecticut which she has,2,2,22
2789,"At the time the case was brought up to Court, shed been a resident of Connecticut for two years",2,5,22
2790,"No, it does not Your Honor",1,8,22
2791,"It means, an intent to reside in Connecticut so long as it takes to become a member of the Bar",2,2,22
2792,"Once one has become a member of the Bar, you need no longer to have to that intent",1,10,22
2793,"For example --
Residency means living there",2,5,22
2794,Just being there,2,5,22
2795,"I, for example, Im a member of the Connecticut Bar, a Commissioner of the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut as I stand here right now",2,3,22
2796,I have not resided in the State of Connecticut for two years,2,3,22
2797,"I have been to Connecticut only twice in those two years, both times in connection with this lawsuit",2,3,22
2798,I became a member of the Bar at the State of Connecticut after my graduation from a law school in the State of Connecticut,2,3,22
2799,No questions were asked to me and no questions are required by the rules in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut that I intend to permanently reside in the State of Connecticut,2,3,22
2800,"Rule 8 (2) says, “You must either reside in the State of Connecticut or intend to reside in the State of Connecticut",2,2,22
2801,"”
It does not require an intention to permanently reside in the State of Connecticut",1,10,22
2802,"I recently --
I think residence in fact does mean just that",1,10,22
2803,"That you are at the time you make application for the admission to the Bar, have the intention to reside",2,2,22
2804,I take it domicile to mean actually physically be present,2,2,22
2805,That would not,1,10,22
2806,"I think domicile intents (Voice Overlap)
Yes, I dont think the intent can reasonably said to be indefinitely",2,3,22
2807,The intent must be to stay there having no particular plans to leave at this time to go some place else,1,9,22
2808,This is where I am now,2,2,22
2809,Im not definitely living some place else,2,3,22
2810,No I dont think so,1,12,22
2811,I dont think (Voice Overlap),1,9,22
2812,"Based on the rules of the State of Connecticut, that is quite right",1,10,22
2813,Thats (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2814,No thats (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2815,"No, thats absolutely not the position here",1,10,22
2816,One has to take -- one has not only fill out the questionnaire,1,10,22
2817,but be interviewed by the Bar Committee,0,0,22
2818,And the Bar Committee is satisfied to these qualifications,1,10,22
2819,As to his residency in the State of Connecticut then it seems clear under the rule of the State of Connecticut that hes admissible,2,5,22
2820,Im saying that thats what the rule of the State of Connecticut requires,2,3,22
2821,That is not my position,1,10,22
2822,The Constitution does not require that,1,12,22
2823,"The original question asked by you was with regard there was not the purpose to make sure that there was a residency, if the people were residents of the State in which they were lawyers",1,10,22
2824,"In fact, the State of Connecticut does not require more than what you have described",1,10,22
2825,If the State of Connecticut were to just require a six-month residency requirement that may work well withstand the test of constitutionality,2,5,22
2826,"The New Mexico case which you recently denied cert on --
Thats correct",2,5,22
2827,It does not,1,8,22
2828,Connecticut could require constitutionally,1,12,22
2829,It has not,1,10,22
2830,"If this case, does come down to my client on the Connecticut rule qualify",2,2,22
2831,"because she wasnt back in the Connecticut in the opinion of the Board of Bar Examiners, a resident under that rule",2,5,22
2832,That has been so found and it is not disputed,1,10,22
2833,That Connecticut has no further requirements other than domicile or intention to be a resident,1,10,22
2834,"In this case is, yes",0,0,22
2835,"Someone could come to Connecticut and stay there, and if the board was satisfied with that (Voice Overlap)",2,3,22
2836,Connecticut could change its rule and require more about way of residence (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2837,It cannot require a citizen,2,2,22
2838,It can require more by way of residency than it does,2,2,22
2839,"No, that is not the issue",1,10,22
2840,Thats what this case is about,2,5,22
2841,"That is the way the rule is written, yes, Your Honor",2,2,22
2842,I did not write the rule nor do I say that (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2843,That is the Statement of the rule of the State of Connecticut,2,2,22
2844,That is not a constitutional requirement,1,10,22
2845,"Now in this case --
If the Board of Bar Examiners were satisfied that he met the residency requirement under the facts that you stated, he would be certified by the board to that",2,5,22
2846,"That that is a constitutional requirement, I deny",1,10,22
2847,Im not sure I understand it,1,11,22
2848,"If youre saying that he comes from Virginia for example to Connecticut and establishes residency under the minimum requirements the State of Connecticut presently has, and he should be able to do that with a resident alien status from Canada",2,2,22
2849,"Yes, I am saying that",0,0,22
2850,"because thats the Connecticut rule,",0,0,22
2851,but Im not saying that this is a constitutional requirement,0,0,22
2852,It is not,1,8,22
2853,They could establish I think a longer residency requirement and stricter standards for residency,2,2,22
2854,In no event -- may they condition it on being a citizen,2,5,22
2855,"With regard to constitutional considerations by a Bar Examining Committee?
My client, as a resident alien, a permanent resident alien may reside in the United States indefinitely",2,5,22
2856,She is subject to the laws of that right on conditions that do not apply to citizens,2,2,22
2857,"If she is guilty of conduct that is prescribed by the Federal statute, you know, habitual drunkenness, they are spelled out in immigration naturalization, she could still be subject to deportation",2,5,22
2858,"They are certainly less stringent rules than one would expect of a bar association, so that were she guilty of those same acts and misconduct, she should certainly be disbarred before she is deported",1,10,22
2859,But she is permanently has a right to be here under the present statutory scheme,2,5,22
2860,"No, Your Honor",2,5,22
2861,She in fact got that status before she married a United States citizen,2,3,22
2862,"The -- by virtue or the fact of marrying a United States citizen, she achieves one thing that she did not have earlier and that is that she could become a United States citizen in three years rather than five years",2,2,22
2863,But she got her permanent resident status prior to marrying a United States citizen,2,3,22
2864,Id like to address myself to one inquiry raised by the brief of the State of Connecticut and that is that Graham versus Richardson does not apply in this case with regard to the standard,1,10,22
2865,That the classification based on alienage is subject to strict judicial scrutiny and that the State of Connecticut must show a compelling interest that this classification is necessary to me,1,10,22
2866,This is stated on page 5 of the brief of the State of Connecticut where it is held that no inquiry beyond reasonableness is really needed,1,10,22
2867,"The reason that an alienage classification does receive special scrutiny, namely the aliens non participation in Government fails here",1,10,22
2868,because the non participation is a purpose served by the classification,2,2,22
2869,"As I understand that statement, the State of Connecticut is saying that Graham does not apply",1,10,22
2870,because of the fact that the very exclusion of aliens from the process of Government is the purpose of the rule,2,2,22
2871,"I would take it that what they mean is that if aliens have the right to vote, there would be no holding by this Court",1,10,22
2872,"but under the Fourteenth Amendment, all such classifications are subject to strict judicial scrutiny",1,10,22
2873,I would point out two examples where this is not the case,1,8,22
2874,That is that the franchise or the right to vote is not the purpose for the strict judicial scrutiny rule,1,10,22
2875,"Children cannot vote and to my knowledge, this Court has not said, that by virtue thereof all classifications with regard to children are subject to the standard in Graham, a strict judicial scrutiny of a necessary and compelling interest",2,2,22
2876,"Secondly, convicted felons cannot vote and I would be surprised if this Court would seriously entertain an attack on the 1968 Crime Control Gun Provisions, that govern felons possessions of registered and unregistered firearms on the grounds that they cannot vote",2,2,22
2877,The reason that classifications based on alienage are subject to the strict judicial scrutiny is,1,10,22
2878,because of their analogous characteristic to racial classifications and classifications based on sex,2,2,22
2879,The State of Connecticut has to show a compelling interest thats furthered by this classification and that the means are necessary to further this classification,1,10,22
2880,"It would -- it would not necessarily outlaw it,",1,10,22
2881,but I will it this way Your Honor,0,0,22
2882,"The question would be could a prohibition as all the States have, against voting by aliens withstand the test of Graham, that it need a strict --
I think that it cannot",1,10,22
2883,"I think that under the holding in Graham, that the fact that an alien suffers the disabilities must pay the taxes, must be subject to all the laws of the Government, would be a strong argument and that a strong constitutional argument I point in",1,10,22
2884,"I think that on the facts as I understand, it would prevail, yes Your Honor",1,8,22
2885,I would take that would one reason,1,10,22
2886,"I would say, it would make my case more troublesome to answer that, yes Your Honor",0,0,22
2887,"No, I think so, both",0,0,22
2888,Whether yes and no by some examples Your Honor,2,2,22
2889,I think there is a difference under -- even if the Court went as far as Mr,1,10,22
2890,Justice White as said that these rules might compel it there is still a difference between an alien and a citizen,2,2,22
2891,The Fourteenth Amendment talks about the privileges and immunities of citizenship,2,2,22
2892,"A citizen by the virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment has the privilege permanently to reside in the State as a citizen of that State, no matter what his conduct maybe, and is immune from the laws of citizenship, or from deportation from the United States, no matter what his conduct maybe or what we may think of him",2,5,22
2893,That is not the case,1,10,22
2894,That is not a privilege or immunity of an alien,2,2,22
2895,An alien is entitled only to due process and equal protection of the laws,2,5,22
2896,"Equal protection of the laws and due process or from deportation?
A State cannot take away if he is entitled, cannot have that taken away",2,5,22
2897,"Thats true, State cannot chase him out",1,8,22
2898,I realize the Constitution is fully distinguishable,1,8,22
2899,There are jobs (Voice Overlap),2,2,22
2900,Yes,1,12,22
2901,"Would have to meet the test thats laid down in Graham of showing a compelling interest, yes",1,10,22
2902,That is not the case that has to be decided here,1,10,22
2903,What the record might show with regard the voting is another matter,1,8,22
2904,"What the record shows in this case, with regard to attorneys is quite different",1,10,22
2905,"This case is one step removed from the decision you must make in the case that was argued yesterday, Sugarman",2,2,22
2906,We do not concede that our client has the status of a governmental official,1,10,22
2907,She is not asking to be a member in the Government,2,3,22
2908,She is asking to be an attorney in the State of Connecticut,2,3,22
2909,The State seeks to analogize her to a governmental official,1,8,22
2910,"They seek to analogize her by a virtue of the position that she would hold as an attorney in Connecticut, as a Commissioner of the Superior Court",2,2,22
2911,"The State argues this on what they call a self-evident proposition that after all, the Government of the State of Connecticut has a right to limit its positions to citizens thereof",1,10,22
2912,"In fact, the State of Connecticut does not limit positions for attorneys or commissioners of Superior Courts to citizens of the State of Connecticut",1,10,22
2913,"I am both an attorney in the State of Connecticut, I am a commissioner of the Superior Court, I cannot vote in the State of Connecticut, I am not a resident of the State of Connecticut, and yet I have all of these positions that they seek to deny my client on the grounds that she is not a citizen",2,4,22
2914,"The difference is that the State of Connecticut does not compel citizenship of Connecticut, the State of Connecticut compels citizenship of the United States",1,10,22
2915,The practitioner as an attorney takes the oath that he will not be guilty of any malice or take anybody's money without just representation or allow any fraud to be perpetuated on the Court,2,2,22
2916,The significant oath is called the Oath of the Commissioners Court or the Superior Court and that oath is I will uphold the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Connecticut so long as I remain a citizen thereof,2,3,22
2917,Thats the Connecticut statute in Section 125,2,2,22
2918,"(Voice Overlap)
So long as I remain a citizen thereof",0,0,22
2919,The oaths certainly mean something,1,9,22
2920,Its a symbol that one is going to do just precisely what they say,1,8,22
2921,Thats correct Your Honor,1,12,22
2922,"Obviously, Im no longer a citizen thereof and still have all the positions of an attorney",2,5,22
2923,That does not make the oath meaningless when I take it,1,10,22
2924,Thats correct,1,12,22
2925,We have suggested that this very statute in question provides for an alternative vote and that she should be required to take the oath that she will uphold the Constitution of the United States and the State of Connecticut,2,2,22
2926,"So long she remains a citizen thereof, obviously, she cant assert that, that cant be a meaningful part of the oath for someone whos not a citizen of either one",2,5,22
2927,"In the alternative, if the State of Connecticut which has not ruled on the possibility of a judge changing the oath, and the power to administer alternative oath is vested in the judiciary",2,2,22
2928,"If they will not change the oath, then under the argument, the oath would have to be unconstitutional",1,10,22
2929,Because it would just be another way of requiring that all applicants for admission to the Bar be citizens,2,2,22
2930,Yes it is your Honor,1,12,22
2931,"The -- Im sorry, the form of the oath --
-- is in the supplemental, appears in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement",2,2,22
2932,"Page 44 on my --
Page 44, that is the oath of the attorney",2,2,22
2933,Yes there is Your Honor,1,12,22
2934,That is the problem,1,10,22
2935,"If my client takes the oath as required under the Naturalization Act, she will lose her Dutch citizenship",2,5,22
2936,"Yes you can Your Honor and as stated throughout that she will take both of the oaths (Voice Overlap)
Thats correct",2,3,22
2937,Thats the only restriction I meant to imply,1,10,22
2938,And the State of Connecticut,2,2,22
2939,"If youre asking me to speculate on that, there would seem to be that possibility yes",1,10,22
2940,"Certainly, if this oath were taken after the declaration of war between the two countries that would be a strong presumption",1,10,22
2941,"That it will be taken before --
I think it she would really have to make an election at that time, yes Your Honor",1,10,22
2942,Were not saying the fact of alienage is totally irrelevant as a clue,1,10,22
2943,That the bar character committee can consider in passing on applications,1,10,22
2944,"Were saying that an across the board prohibition against aliens does not meet the standard, laid down in Graham of furthering a compelling State interest",1,10,22
2945,We think that alienage has very little to do character,1,8,22
2946,In some you know -- I certainly tend to agree with you,1,12,22
2947,I think alienage is totally irrelevant to admission to the Bar,1,9,22
2948,"Obviously, four other states (Voice Overlap)
I use the term character possibly broader than Your Honor does and that it seems to me that under the decisions, there are two general classifications; competence and character",2,2,22
2949,"Now, in Baird, in Law Students Research Council, what you classified under the character included inquiries into political beliefs and loyalty",2,2,22
2950,"Now, what we are obviously talking about here, when we talk about citizenship and non-citizenship has something to do with allegiance as Mr",1,10,22
2951,Justice White has averted to numerous times,1,10,22
2952,Thats what I mean when I say it falls under character,1,10,22
2953,"Were talking about the types of things dealing with loyalty oaths which is precisely what this Court has dealt with, with regard to admission to the Bar",2,2,22
2954,"Can she contentiously take that oath?
The answer is yes",1,10,22
2955,It is never been disputed that,1,10,22
2956,She can contentiously take the oath,1,9,22
2957,She may elect United States citizenship on that contingency,2,2,22
2958,"I dont know what she will do on that contingency (Voice Overlap) then obviously, she will have her -- this Government were at war with the Netherlands",2,5,22
2959,Do you know in advance what she might elect with regard to contingencies concerning wars in the United States,2,2,22
2960,I dont think any of us can predict those contingencies forever in the future,1,8,22
2961,I think thats a contingency not all together unique to an alien or (Voice Overlap),2,3,22
2962,That is correct,1,12,22
2963,That what is the State of Connecticut is saying,1,10,22
2964,It applies to all resident aliens,1,10,22
2965,It applies to all -- yes Your Honor,2,2,22
2966,It applies to one who has filed a declaration of intent to be a citizen,2,2,22
2967,Yes I would,1,12,22
2968,"In fact, this case was brought before any knowledge of the Graham case",2,5,22
2969,It was filed in 1970 before Graham was decided by the three-judge court and Graham was decided by this Court after it was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court,2,2,22
2970,It follows from the Truax decision,1,10,22
2971,I dont see any inconsistency between Truax and Graham and I think those are the main cases that interpret the Fourteenth Amendment this way,1,10,22
2972,"And I think the answer to your question is yes, you do not have to rely exclusively on Graham",1,10,22
2973,Thank you,0,0,22
2974,Mr,0,0,23
2975,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Jicarilla Apache Nation has sued the government for mismanaging millions of dollars of its trust monies",2,5,23
2976,"No trustee in this situation, including the government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice that it has received about managing the beneficiary's money",2,5,23
2977,"The beneficiary is entitled to see that legal advice, so that it can determine whether the trustee followed the advice",2,5,23
2978,"I -- I -- I do not -- I do not, Mr",0,0,23
2979,Chief Justice,2,2,23
2980,"The -- the notion of -- the issue here is an issue of evidence, and it is controlled by Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts that resolve claims of privilege based on common law principles",2,2,23
2981,"Under the common law, a trustee cannot assert the attorney-client privilege to withhold from a fiduciary legal advice about management of the trust",2,5,23
2982,"That, I submit, is the end of the analysis",1,12,23
2983,"Your Honor, there are very -- there are a handful of States that have not recognized the fiduciary exception,",2,2,23
2984,but there is no Federal circuit that has refused to recognize it,2,2,23
2985,"Indeed, all of the Federal circuits that have considered it have adopted it, and it is recognized in both, as we stated in our brief, the Restatement of Trusts and the Restatement of the law Governing Lawyers",2,2,23
2986,"Justice Scalia, I -- I cannot cite a specific case--
--But that's not correct, if -- if I may, Mr",0,0,23
2987,Justice,1,12,23
2988,"If you look at the seminal American decision, the Riggs Bank decision that's cited in both briefs, they talk about the rationales and they said that the first rationale is that the trustee acts as a proxy for the beneficiary in obtaining the advice",2,2,23
2989,The second rationale is that the trustee has a general duty to disclose relevant information to the beneficiary,1,10,23
2990,"The Court mentioned that one factor that it would look at was who had paid for the legal advice,",2,5,23
2991,"but it did not suggest that that was determinative, and indeed subsequent case law has made clear that it is not, and the Restatement says explicitly that who paid is not the controlling factor",2,5,23
2992,Not that I can cite right now,1,10,23
2993,"But it would be--
--Yes, Your Honor",0,0,23
2994,"But the issue -- this is, I submit, letting the tail wag the dog",2,5,23
2995,What we are talking about is money that belongs to the beneficiary,2,2,23
2996,We're talking about money,2,5,23
2997,We're not talking about a bare trust,1,10,23
2998,We're talking about a full-fledged trust under Mitchell 2,2,5,23
2999,"Indeed, this Court in Mitchell 2 said that trusts involving the management of Indian money were full-fledged trusts",2,2,23
3000,"And in that situation for the government to say that, while any private fiduciary would be obliged to show to the beneficiary the legal advice it's received when there's an issue about whether it's fulfilled its fiduciary duties, it's different",2,5,23
3001,because we've spent our hard-earned money on these lawyers and we own the records in issue,2,5,23
3002,"I mean, that doesn't make sense",1,9,23
3003,"And basically as a matter of discovery, which is where we are right now, the posture of the case, whenever you seek discovery, in virtually all of those circumstances the documents in issue are going to belong to the opposing party",2,2,23
3004,Right,1,12,23
3005,"My response to that would be twofold, Your Honor",1,8,23
3006,"The first is that that same argument can be made for any private fiduciary, yet the courts have felt that the more important relationship is the relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary, that that trumps the need for or the desirability for private discussions between the--
--Right",2,2,23
3007,"Well, if it's never shared, Your Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the trustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to its advantage in a breach of trust suit",2,5,23
3008,"I think the issue, Your Honor, is whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is seeking",1,10,23
3009,"If the trustee is seeking advice about personal liability, then I certainly agree that the trustee could do that",1,10,23
3010,"If the trustee instead is seeking advice, regardless of who pays for it,",2,5,23
3011,"but is seeking legal advice about how the trustee should manage money belonging to the beneficiary--
--Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit that the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of trust, which is the precondition for all of this, whether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to produce the legal advice that it has received so the beneficiary can be--
--Yes, Your Honor, that's the position",0,0,23
3012,And that puts the government in no different position than private beneficiaries or ERISA beneficiaries or any other sorts of beneficiaries,2,5,23
3013,"Justice Kennedy, let me respond to that",0,0,23
3014,"And I agree that who is paying for it -- if the trustee is paying for it out of his own or her own pocket, that is a factor that certainly should be looked at and would be entitled to -- to some weight in terms of what the purpose of the advice was for;",1,10,23
3015,"but ultimately the issue is whether the trustee is seeking to protect personal interests, protect against a claim of liability, for example, or whether is -- the trustee is looking for advice about how to manage the beneficiary's money",1,10,23
3016,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,23
3017,"I think, Your Honor, that if it focuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's prospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not privileged",2,5,23
3018,"If, instead, you posit, you know, this is what I did and I'm concerned I may have screwed up, do you think I'm liable, then I think a different answer may obtain",0,0,23
3019,"Please tell me what to do, yes",2,5,23
3020,"Well, Your Honor, I agree preventative advice is the most -- is among the most important one can give",1,10,23
3021,"But why should the government be in a different position with regard to this than the private beneficiary?
Your Honor, the Court said in the Sears decision, which is the cited in our brief -- I believe it's in footnote 16 -- that citizens' access rights under FOIA are not necessarily coextensive with--
--That, Your Honor, and also the fundamental--
--Right",0,0,23
3022,"I would say--
--I would say, Your Honor, that this Court's decision in Julian, where it said that different classes of persons may have different rights under FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the right of the beneficiaries",0,0,23
3023,We're not talking about the citizen's right to see how Indian trust monies have been managed,1,10,23
3024,"But I believe that under the precedent in Julian, that it would be that what we're talking about here is access to Indians whose money is being managed",2,5,23
3025,"Well, Your Honor, again I come back that the trustee is entitled where the issue is liability, rather than how to manage the money",2,5,23
3026,The -- that gets into an area that would not be subject to the fiduciary exceptions,2,5,23
3027,"So if that is the focus of the advice, a private beneficiary wouldn't have to give up that advice and we don't contend that the government should, either",1,10,23
3028,"But where, as here, all of the documents are general documents that deal generally with how to manage Indian trust funds--
--Well, Your Honor, at -- at some logical level there is a link there that can never be severed,",2,2,23
3029,"but I submit, respectfully, that the government, when it's getting advice about managing trust funds, is not really focused on its liability",0,0,23
3030,"The government's liability, after all, is much more circumscribed than private fiduciaries, in any number of ways",2,2,23
3031,"It is seeking legal advice about what is the proper way to invest, can we do this, can we pool funds, can we do -- you know, can we make a certain type of investment or is it prohibited to us",2,5,23
3032,And advice of that nature is advice to which the beneficiary is entitled,2,2,23
3033,"A private beneficiary -- the beneficiaries of private trusts are entitled, and Indians, whose money is being managed",2,2,23
3034,"because the government has taken on itself by statute and said, we are going to take control of your monies and we're going to manage them, have no lesser right to get access to this highly relevant information when they litigate for breach of trust",2,5,23
3035,"In fact, Your Honor, there is some case law that says the fiduciary exception can be applied to -- to work product",2,2,23
3036,We did not press that point in the Court of Federal Claims,2,2,23
3037,"We -- focused our request for documents on attorney-client, not on work product",2,5,23
3038,"Yes, Your Honor, which is exactly what happened here",2,5,23
3039,"The Court of Federal Claims reviewed all of the documents in camera and made a document-by-document determination, which is, of course, the standard approach when you're talking about attorney-client privilege",2,2,23
3040,It's done on a document by document basis,2,2,23
3041,"It didn't come up, Your Honor,",0,0,23
3042,because there weren't any retrospective wants,2,2,23
3043,"They're all prospective, Your Honor",2,2,23
3044,They're all prospective,2,2,23
3045,"The--
--Yes, Your Honor",0,0,23
3046,"The -- I want to pick up, I believe it was on a comment that you made, Justice Sotomayor, when you said that under the government's theory there would be no need for Rule 501",0,0,23
3047,"And indeed, they say that it's not enough",2,5,23
3048,501 on its face says apply common law principles,2,2,23
3049,And the government's argument is that's not enough unless there's some other statute that requires common law principles to be applied to this,1,10,23
3050,"Now, this is a neat trick",1,10,23
3051,"You just read 501 out of the Rules of Evidence when it comes to the government, notwithstanding that 501 itself says it's to be used to determine privilege claims by the government, and that's reinforced in Federal Rule of Evidence 1101, which specifically says that the Rules of Evidence are to apply in the Court of Federal Claims",2,2,23
3052,"Your Honor, it -- I think that that could pick up on the same distinction that the Court has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2, between bare trust and a full-fledged trust",0,0,23
3053,The government may have a general duty to act in the interests of all citizens,1,10,23
3054,"Indeed, I think we would all agree with that",1,10,23
3055,But that does not mean that the government is engaging in the conduct of a full-fledged trust with respect to citizens,2,2,23
3056,It's not,1,8,23
3057,"Its relationship to citizens day in and day out is akin to, in fact maybe even a level below, the bare trust relationship that was at issue in Mitchell 1",1,10,23
3058,"So, we're not proposing a -- a sweeping new rule here",1,9,23
3059,"It's the government that's proposing to transform this Court's jurisprudence about Indians,",2,2,23
3060,"because the notion that the only enforceable obligations it has are those set forth in statute or regulation, were the Court to adopt that, it would be overruling its decision in White Mountain Apache",2,2,23
3061,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,23
3062,"Well, the -- the principal one we could find, which is cited in our brief, is with respect to government retirees who make voluntary contributions to their fund, and the government's argument here could be applied to them",0,0,23
3063,"Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy for it to be",2,5,23
3064,I believe it should be,1,9,23
3065,Yes,1,12,23
3066,"I might add, Your Honor, fortunately it's not the Bureau of Indian Affairs that runs that",2,2,23
3067,"Your Honor, no, frankly it hasn't come up that much with -- in terms of Federal retirees",2,5,23
3068,There's the Cavanaugh v,0,0,23
3069,Wainstein case that we cite in our brief which is about the only published decision I've been able to find,2,2,23
3070,"The fact of the matter, I -- I was being humorous a moment ago,",0,0,23
3071,"but the fact of the matter is that the government retirement funds have been, it appears, run quite well and there have been relatively few claims brought against them",2,5,23
3072,"There's a reason that there are a bunch of pending cases regarding Indian--
--That's the Julian case, Your Honor",2,2,23
3073,"I'm sorry, it's not cited in our brief",2,5,23
3074,I will -- it -- 486 U,0,0,23
3075,S,0,0,23
3076,"1, 1988, Your Honor",0,0,23
3077,"The -- there is another inconsistency in the government's position here that I would like to highlight for the Court, if I may",0,0,23
3078,That is this: The government relies on the common law in the first place to say it has a privilege,1,10,23
3079,There's no statute that gives the government attorney-client privilege,2,2,23
3080,So it relies on common law saying: We have an attorney-client privilege,2,2,23
3081,"Now, that's fine under Federal Rule 501",2,5,23
3082,"But the government says, while it can rely on common law, Jicarilla cannot rely on that same common law to establish the limits on the privilege it's claiming",2,5,23
3083,"This Court described that sort of argument as
""heads I win, tails you lose",2,2,23
3084,"""
and said that it can't be right",1,10,23
3085,And I submit that it can't be right here,1,12,23
3086,"The--
--I agree, Your Honor, that that's their claim",0,0,23
3087,"But the government hasn't shown how the fact that it is the sovereign, which we certainly concede, makes any meaningful difference for purposes of the issue presented here",2,5,23
3088,"The cases it cites establish that the government,",2,2,23
3089,"because it is sovereign, in some instances has broader authority than a private trustee would to help out the beneficiary",2,5,23
3090,"And I believe that that is--
--Well, Your Honor, I agree,",0,0,23
3091,"but the issue of conflicting, competing interests, first of all it arises in the private trust context and it arises frequently",2,2,23
3092,"Anytime you've got a life beneficiary and a remainderman, you've got a potential conflict between the beneficiaries; and this issue of conflict has led to the development of the duty of impartiality for private trustees; and it's discussed at length in section 79 of the Restatement",2,2,23
3093,So the notion of competing interests is not unique to the government,2,2,23
3094,The government may have some different competing interests than a private trustee might have,2,5,23
3095,That's certainly conceivable,1,10,23
3096,"And if it does, the existence of a specific competing interest may affect whether the action that the government takes is or is not a breach of trust",1,10,23
3097,"That's correct, Your Honor",0,0,23
3098,"Well, Your Honor, I submit that it's not totally--
--Well, Your Honor, you're positing that the trustee has a personal interest that's adverse to the beneficiary",2,5,23
3099,That's correct,1,12,23
3100,Those are competing responsibilities,1,8,23
3101,"I agree that the government may have that, and that may affect whether the decision that they ultimately make is or is not an appropriate decision",1,10,23
3102,But it does not affect their duty to disclose as a matter of evidence the legal advice that they use to make that judgment,2,2,23
3103,"The beneficiary, when the beneficiary's money is at stake, is entitled to see what advice the government acted on in dealing with its money",2,5,23
3104,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,23
3105,I don't -- I submit that the ultimate balancing of interests here is the same as it is for a private fiduciary,1,10,23
3106,There is no -- the Court -- we urge the Court to affirm that under Rule 501 Indian tribes are entitled to the same evidence as other trust beneficiaries about how their money was managed,2,5,23
3107,That is our request of this Court,2,5,23
3108,"Yes, Your Honor",1,12,23
3109,"I think that may in a theoretical sense be true, Your Honor",1,8,23
3110,"But practically speaking, there's a difference between the BIA officials who are acting as the trustee and the attorneys who are advising the trustee",1,10,23
3111,Our claim is against the trustee,2,5,23
3112,It's not against the attorneys,1,9,23
3113,We are not seeking to impose any professional responsibilities on the government attorneys,1,10,23
3114,Thank you,0,0,23
3115,"Thank you, Mr",0,0,24
3116,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Albrecht should be overruled",0,0,24
3117,"because its doctrinal underpinnings have been eroded, and also",2,2,24
3118,because its perpetuation is likely to do considerably more competitive harm than good,2,5,24
3119,"Per se rules are reserved for business practices that are manifestly, self-evidently, if not always, at least almost always, anti-competitive, whereas maximum resale price agreements are rarely in that category",2,2,24
3120,"If anything, we submit, they are more likely to be pro-competitive",2,5,24
3121,"For example, as the Court express",0,0,24
3122,"expressly recognized in Arco, a maximum can constrain dealer market power, which is something that, in varying degrees, can exist from time to time",1,10,24
3123,"These maximums also serve other important purposes relating to price, advertising and discounting, which is undermined by a per se rule",1,10,24
3124,"I should add, as precedent, Albrecht has had an especially difficult time of it",1,9,24
3125,Its dealer autonomy and dealer multiplicity rationales were undermined in Sylvania,2,2,24
3126,And I do think that that doesn't mean that a minimum falls,1,10,24
3127,The difference is that minimum resale price-fixing has entirely different effects and,1,10,24
3128,both pro-competitive and anti-competitive,1,10,24
3129,"But it's not the abstract notion of dealer autonomy, Justice Stevens, that's critical here",1,10,24
3130,And I would dare say that Albrecht got a remarkably chilly reception in the Arco case,2,2,24
3131,The lower Federal courts have whittled away at it,2,5,24
3132,The commentators have been extraordinarily critical of it,2,2,24
3133,I'd be,2,3,24
3134,I'd be delighted to,1,10,24
3135,I,0,0,24
3136,I think there are two things I'd like to say about it,1,10,24
3137,"First of all, what's significant is that the States themselves don't cite a single instance, and we in the Federal Government could find no instances, where an enforcement agency brought a maximum case",2,2,24
3138,"And that seems to me to be very, very telling",1,10,24
3139,"That is, in the 30 years",2,5,24
3140,"since Albrecht, none of them appear to have brought such a case",2,5,24
3141,"Second, their concern",2,5,24
3142,if you read their briefs,2,5,24
3143,"their concern is, somehow, if you breach the wall in this pricing area, that you won't be able to stop at minimum",2,5,24
3144,"Now, I think minimum presents very different effects",1,8,24
3145,"And in fact, their key argument is that maximum could be a minimum",1,10,24
3146,"But my answer to that is, if it is a minimum, it will be treated by a minimum",1,10,24
3147,"And, frankly, I don't see any problem in detection",1,10,24
3148,The notion that somehow you could disguise this,1,8,24
3149,"after all, the first person who is likely to object is going to be the dealer",2,5,24
3150,And if the dealer thinks that its price wants,2,5,24
3151,"he wants to drive his price down, he's entirely free to do so",1,10,24
3152,"And if he gets punished for that, then we know that it's a minimum",2,5,24
3153,So this notion that it's undetectable seems to me to be a very hard one to sustain,1,8,24
3154,"Now, in addition, the only other arguments of maximum and minimum, which I think is the most telling thing about the States' brief, Justice O'Connor, is they really are fighting for another day",2,2,24
3155,"And if that day should come, entirely different competitive considerations will be at play",1,10,24
3156,"But the other thing that's very telling about it, the only other argument you see in the briefs is that a maximum price could affect dealer service",2,2,24
3157,"Now, that",0,0,24
3158,that,0,0,24
3159,"that's a reasonable concern,",0,0,24
3160,but I would say several things about it,0,0,24
3161,"One, there's no reason to think that the manufacturer is not interested in dealer service that has a pro-competitive benefit",1,10,24
3162,"This Court recognized, in GTE, it recognized in Sharp, that manufacturers have an interest in order to maximize their profit in an efficient distribution system",2,2,24
3163,"Second, and it seems to me crucial, is that under the law now, after GTE/Sylvania, you can actually impose specific service limitations in your contract",1,10,24
3164,"For example, McDonald's can say to all of its dealers: You can't have waiters",2,2,24
3165,It destroys the ambience,2,5,24
3166,Waiters,2,5,24
3167,In a fast-food restaurant,2,2,24
3168,They can condition a McDonald's franchise on that limitation on service,2,2,24
3169,The,0,0,24
3170,the,0,0,24
3171,"the manufacturer here, the gas State",2,5,24
3172,gas company here could say: You can't wash windows,2,2,24
3173,You can't do tires,1,10,24
3174,They can put that in there,2,5,24
3175,"Now, that may be anti-competitive ultimately,",0,0,24
3176,but it would be tested by a rule of reason,0,0,24
3177,"So the notion that we would have a per se rule, basically",0,0,24
3178,because it might impact service,2,5,24
3179,"a price restriction might impact service, seems to me to have the cart way before the horse in terms of what would go on, on a direct restriction",1,10,24
3180,"And, beyond that, those are the two generic circumstances: maximum/minimum and effect on service",1,10,24
3181,"Beyond that, the only other notion that comes up is a possibility of predation",1,10,24
3182,"And if there is predation, of course, that would be a violation",2,5,24
3183,"But the Court, in Brook and many other cases, has realized that that's quite rare",2,5,24
3184,So the key point here is that this is not the stuff of which per se rules are made,1,10,24
3185,Whether you could imagine a case is not the question,1,10,24
3186,"If there is such a case and there's competitive effects, the rule of reason is there, as it is for virtually all business practices",2,2,24
3187,"What the per se rule is reserved for, what it has its real currency in is practices that one ought to look at and say, this is really bad stuff; you don't need to do an in-depth examination",2,2,24
3188,"Now, what's on the other side of the equation?
First of all, you asked about exclusives",0,0,24
3189,But it's not just exclusives,2,2,24
3190,Look at the facts in Albrecht,2,2,24
3191,"You can have, if you will, de facto market power",2,2,24
3192,"If you're a newspaper dealer, it's",2,5,24
3193,it's really the case that you're going to have an area which you,1,10,24
3194,you deliver these newspapers to,2,2,24
3195,"And unlike the newspaper company, the dealer might well say, look, I have some market power; people in Washington, D",2,5,24
3196,C,0,0,24
3197,want to wake up on a Saturday morning and see their newspaper there,2,3,24
3198,"I can charge more than a quarter for that, before they're going to go out to a machine or downtown or something like that",2,2,24
3199,And then the dealer can extract real monopoly profits in that situation,2,2,24
3200,I don't,1,11,24
3201,I,0,0,24
3202,I don't think it's,1,11,24
3203,it may be the States' concern,1,10,24
3204,"I don't think it's a realistic concern, Justice Kennedy, for sev",1,10,24
3205,several reasons,1,9,24
3206,"To begin with, there is a lot of discussion about price, as this Court has recognized, time and again",2,2,24
3207,"You can have a suggested manufacturers' retail price, as long as there's no agreement",2,5,24
3208,But they discuss it all the time,2,5,24
3209,"Second, it seems to me, this notion that somehow talking about this issue will lead to unlawful agreements, I think, if there is such an unlawful agreement that results, then we can address that problem in that particular case",0,0,24
3210,But I don't see any reason to somehow say that we need to eliminate from the air discussions of price,2,2,24
3211,Manufacturers and their retailers discuss price all the time,1,10,24
3212,"I think that that's right, Mr",1,10,24
3213,Chief Justice,2,2,24
3214,I would say two things,1,10,24
3215,"One, I think, as this Court has recognized, the standard under the antitrust law is a little different from many statutes,",1,10,24
3216,"because it is a common law statute, in which this Court has revised and changed over the years",2,3,24
3217,"GTE/Sylvania said that, and the Court did as well in Copperweld",2,2,24
3218,And I think it has recognized that principle,1,8,24
3219,"But I think, whatever standard you apply, it can be met here",1,8,24
3220,"I think if you look at GTE/Sylvania, you will see that the basic notions that animated the decision in",1,8,24
3221,in Albrecht are no longer viable,2,2,24
3222,There was a view in the mid-eighties that actually animated Schwinn,2,2,24
3223,"in the mid-sixties, it animated Schwinn and animated Albrecht",2,2,24
3224,that said there ought to be dealer autonomy; we ought to have lots and lots of dealers; that's better than a few dealers,2,5,24
3225,"The Court's opinion, quite clearly, eroded that thinking",1,10,24
3226,"Not only that, it created the very right to",1,10,24
3227,to establish exclusives that Albrecht said was no good,2,2,24
3228,"Albrecht said, well, if you have market power",2,5,24
3229,"because you have an exclusive territorial arrangement, then, under Schwinn, the territory falls",2,2,24
3230,"But now, post-GTE, the territory remains",2,2,24
3231,Then I think the next problem you have is the Court says in Arco,1,10,24
3232,it,1,9,24
3233,it,1,9,24
3234,it's really an interesting opinion,1,10,24
3235,"it starts out by saying: We assume, arguendo, that Albrecht is still good law",1,8,24
3236,It then has a footnote saying: Albrecht was the only case ever that dealt with a pure maximum,2,2,24
3237,"And then it goes on, in footnote 13, and says: The pro-competitive benefits are now, quote, clearer than they were at the time of Albrecht",2,2,24
3238,"And they cite a list of maybe 10 different academic articles, all of which are harshly critical of Albrecht for essentially mis-perceiving its competitive impact",2,5,24
3239,Then you look at what the lower courts have done,2,2,24
3240,"They have constantly read the opinion narrowly, chipping away at it",1,10,24
3241,"No antitrust injury, no injury in fact, no damages, no agreement",2,2,24
3242,Cases involving discounts get distinguished in some sort of ways,1,10,24
3243,So this is anything,1,10,24
3244,but robust,0,0,24
3245,"This is, in",0,0,24
3246,in Judge,0,0,24
3247,"Chief Judge Posner's words, a rather moth eaten foundation",2,2,24
3248,And then the point which I would not discount,1,8,24
3249,Justice Kennedy said there haven't been many such cases in minimum resale price maintenance,2,2,24
3250,The States cite a lot of cases they have brought,2,2,24
3251,The Antitrust Division has brought such cases,2,2,24
3252,The Federal Trade Commission has brought such,2,2,24
3253,such cases,0,0,24
3254,These are real enforcement actions,2,2,24
3255,"In the maximum area, there are no such cases",2,2,24
3256,It's not,1,8,24
3257,because the practice doesn't occur; it's,2,5,24
3258,because government agencies don't find this to be a desirable enforcement vehicle,2,5,24
3259,"And then I would just say the last point, to the extent congressional intent here is relevant",1,10,24
3260,"Of course, in 1991, Congress actually attempted to pass",2,2,24
3261,"it ultimately failed,",1,10,24
3262,"but a different statute passed both houses, trying to reverse this Court's decisions in Sharp and Monsanto",2,2,24
3263,"And while the ultimate statute never passed, Mr",2,5,24
3264,"Chief Justice, both statutes would have ensured",2,2,24
3265,both,0,0,24
3266,both bills,2,2,24
3267,would have ensured that minimum resale price maintenance stayed a per se rule,1,10,24
3268,And they had exceptions for maximum,2,5,24
3269,"So, to the extent one can glint",0,0,24
3270,glim,0,0,24
3271,"take anything from that congressional reaction, Congress, too, realized that Albrecht was no good",2,3,24
3272,It,0,0,24
3273,it,1,9,24
3274,it,1,9,24
3275,I only point to it,1,11,24
3276,I,0,0,24
3277,I put it last on the last,1,9,24
3278,"I only point to it to say to the extent heard anything from them, we've heard that",2,5,24
3279,"what little guidance there is, is minimal, I agree",1,12,24
3280,But the key point is not what Congress did,1,8,24
3281,"This is, in the end, a common law statute",1,10,24
3282,"This Court, I believe, has the obligation to revise and change in this circumstance",1,10,24
3283,"And the reason you should do it, most importantly, is I don't think you should strip manufacturers of a mechanism that is pro-competitive",1,10,24
3284,"If we leave it on the books, that is going to increase market injury",1,10,24
3285,And I think that is a bad result,1,10,24
3286,"Thank you very much, Mr",0,0,24
3287,Chief Justice,2,2,24
3288,Mr,0,0,25
3289,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court",2,5,25
3290,Perhaps I can answer one of the questions which Mr,1,8,25
3291,Justice Clark just asked by reading the document which was written by the Court of Criminal Appeals,2,3,25
3292,I can find it here,2,5,25
3293,"There were four points that he -- that he brought up in that or -- in that order, sir, when he -- when he denied habeas corpus",2,5,25
3294,"It says here that it was admitted in printing in the place where I was looking for it,",2,2,25
3295,but I think it's somewhere else as well,0,0,25
3296,One point was that he had not properly shown that the -- that he -- we needed counsel,1,10,25
3297,Another was that the evidence was sufficient at the time of the trial and that he did not raise the question of his illness correctly,2,5,25
3298,because he did not ask for a motion of continuance,2,5,25
3299,The contention that George Lee Parker is so experienced in his trials that he needed no lawyer,2,2,25
3300,The contention that his defense was premeditated,2,5,25
3301,The contention that appears at page 13 of respondent's brief that it was only in the quite confines of his jail cell that he first realized that he's plan of defense had failed,2,2,25
3302,Founder upon this record,2,5,25
3303,The contention of respondent that this man was not denied due process,2,5,25
3304,Founders upon his admission that this man was not competent to conduct his own trial and that indeed no layman in any matter this intricate can hope to conduct competently his own trial,2,5,25
3305,"The critique procedures which respondent has suggested that Parker can go to a legislature for relief and can go to the Governor for relief and make it more imperative, not less that this Court reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals",2,2,25
3306,because how can this man hope for any hearing from the legislature or from the Governor in the face of the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in this case,2,5,25
3307,"Under the normal circumstances, Mr",0,0,25
3308,"Justice Frankfurter, I believe that this Court should have reversed and -- and vacated the judgments below and remanded the case to the District Court for the entry of a writ of habeas corpus dismissing this man",2,3,25
3309,"Well, dismissing the man from -- from the penitentiary, sir",2,5,25
3310,"If I want to --
If they want to rearrest him, they can",2,2,25
3311,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3312,"Well, yes, sir",2,5,25
3313,But I have thought that that occurred by -- by taking him back into the Court in numerous county and letting him out of the penitentiary,2,5,25
3314,"That's very possible, sir",2,5,25
3315,Witnesses were still available and they still wish to press the charge,2,5,25
3316,"Well, under these circumstances, sir, of course, he already is out of custody",2,5,25
3317,"Your Honor, I'm not claiming that they shouldn't be entitled to do it if they want to,",2,2,25
3318,"but if after he's already served one full sentence for one crime --
No, sir",2,5,25
3319,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3320,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3321,"However, it was the result of that trial he was convicted and was sentenced",2,3,25
3322,I submit that if -- if double jeopardy prevents two trials for the same case that certainly due process should prevent having deserve two sentences for the same case,1,10,25
3323,"Well, Your Honor --
I will not quarrel with that statement, Your Honor",0,0,25
3324,"I believe that in this instance, they failed to do so",1,10,25
3325,And I believe that -- as Mr,0,0,25
3326,"Pesek has said, there is no judicial procedure in Texas for him to prove so",2,2,25
3327,And that is why I think it's very important for this Court to make that statement,1,10,25
3328,"Now, I have suggested the method of a habeas corpus writ issued nunc pro tunc",2,3,25
3329,This is a suggested form of relief which I propose,1,8,25
3330,I certainly feel that petitioner and certainly I would be entirely satisfied with any other form of relief which this -- this Court considers more appropriate,1,10,25
3331,"But I --
Well, it's --
Yes, sir",0,0,25
3332,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3333,"Well, Your Honor, to me, the same principles apply",2,5,25
3334,The question is whether they're -- the -- the Court has lost jurisdiction there by reason of the death of one of the parties,1,10,25
3335,"In this instance, I believe, the question is whether the Court has lost jurisdiction by reason of the release of the prisoner",1,10,25
3336,Nunc pro tunc,1,8,25
3337,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3338,"Well, I'm suggesting, Your Honor, that when it asks that the man be released, it can even be as of the date when he actually was released",2,5,25
3339,"Any day that he was in custody, this Court has jurisdiction to do so",2,2,25
3340,And whether it chooses to do so or not is of course entirely the prerogative of this Court,1,10,25
3341,But I believe that the same principle applies,1,8,25
3342,"Well, Your Honor, I wouldn't regard that as merely a clerical error",1,10,25
3343,"It seems --
That is true, sir",0,0,25
3344,"The doctrine of nunc pro tunc certainly has been used to collect -- is to correct clerical errors,",2,2,25
3345,"but it also has been used to correct judgments -- not to correct judgments, to enter judgments which have not been entered",2,2,25
3346,And this Court has entered no judgment now -- in this case,2,5,25
3347,"Now, in Harris versus Commissioner in 340 U",2,2,25
3348,S,0,0,25
3349,", nunc pro tunc was used by this Court after the death of the Commissioner to avoid abatement",0,0,25
3350,"In Quon Quon Poy versus Johnson which was mentioned earlier, nunc pro tunc was used to enter a judgment which had never been entered and which indeed reversed -- no, it didn't reverse, it -- it affirmed and remanded that man",0,0,25
3351,"But there again, it was the entry of a judgment not the correction of -- of a clerical error",2,5,25
3352,"The -- the only habeas corpus case which I have found, sir, is Quon Quon Poy which was the other side of the coin",2,5,25
3353,But I do believe that -- that did constitute a case,1,10,25
3354,Harris does constitute a case where this Court has entered a judgment after the death of a party which otherwise would have subjected the decision to -- the case to abatement,2,2,25
3355,"And I'm asking here, sir, that the same theory be applied",1,10,25
3356,"Your Honor, I believe Pollard versus the United States is in point in its declaration that there -- there is a possibility of continuing legal consequences and that these are sufficiently substantial to justify your dealing with the merits",1,10,25
3357,"And I believe that the Pollard case although it happens to involved Article 2255, Your Honor's conquering opinion in the Heflin case concurred in by four other justices equates the matter of custody as far as 225 -- 2255 is concerned and as far as 2241 is concerned",2,2,25
3358,I would hope,0,0,25
3359,therefore that this man may also obtain a review on the merits which Pollard obtained,2,5,25
3360,"Now, if there is some other method by which -- if -- if the Court doesn't happen to like nunc pro tunc or it doesn't think it's applicable, if they prefer to say that there is a continuing constructive custody",2,2,25
3361,"because of the degree to which this man's civil liberties are restrained, that will leave us to say be entirely satisfactory to -- to petitioner",2,5,25
3362,because what we believe is that petitioner is entitled to a declaration that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained,2,5,25
3363,"Now, if --
Well --
I would regard this as a decision, sir, which would have in it a declaration",0,0,25
3364,but would also be a decision and indeed an order issued as of a date when the man was in custody,2,5,25
3365,But I repeat that the -- that the main thing that we're after is a recognition here that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained,2,5,25
3366,"Now, if this Court does feel that the case is now moot, then I believe its course is clear under Duke Power Company versus Greenwood under U",1,10,25
3367,S,0,0,25
3368,"versus Munsingwear, this Court should vacate the judgments of the two courts below not leaving them standing to spawn adverse legal consequences as Mr",1,10,25
3369,Justice Douglas mentioned in the opinion of the Court in the Munsingwear case and remand the case to the District Court for dismissal as moot,2,5,25
3370,"Thereby, at least wiping out the Federal stamp of approval which to this day rests upon this conviction",2,5,25
3371,"Now, I believe -- I beg your pardon, sir",0,0,25
3372,Of his application,0,0,25
3373,"Vacation of -- of the judgment and dismissal of his application as moot, his application for habeas corpus",2,5,25
3374,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3375,The federal case to the federal court,2,2,25
3376,"I believe that would, sir",1,8,25
3377,If -- if this Court does not feel that there are continuing consequences which warrant its decision,2,5,25
3378,I hope that the Court will feel that there are,1,9,25
3379,"I believe that merely wiping out erroneous precedents, desirable though that may be is no substitute for creating a correct precedent which can guide the future courts and future decisions including the learned judges of the Fifth Circuit",1,10,25
3380,"And certainly --
As to --
Mr",0,0,25
3381,"Justice Stewart, as far as the -- as -- these people who are still to come to trial, I think the legislature -- legislature's enactment does cure it",2,5,25
3382,"In terms of those who are presently imprisoned, I would hope that the Court of Criminal Appeals would find the Moore situation applicable",2,2,25
3383,But the Moore case was reversed on appeal and not on a writ of habeas corpus,2,5,25
3384,We have not yet seen what the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals will do on a writ of habeas corpus,2,2,25
3385,"Under -- under that circumstance, sir, I believe the appropriate order would be either to issue a writ to yourself or to remand the case to the District Court for a -- an order to be issued by it --
Well, if you do it on that ground, it's little hard to say -- to say what and that's one of my reasons for suggesting the method of -- of a habeas corpus nunc pro tunc",0,0,25
3386,"because we're talking here about respondent Ellis, the General Manager of the Texas Prison System and he, of course, is the State of Texas as is evidenced by the present here -- presence here of my learned opponent",2,2,25
3387,"Your Honor, I certainly think it would be appropriate to do so",1,12,25
3388,"There maybe some other form of order which this Court would regard as more appropriate,",2,3,25
3389,but that is the -- that is the form which I've suggested in my brief,0,0,25
3390,The very availability of the legislative remedies and of pardon as is now sought are the factors which certainly as far as this individual petitioner is concerned do mean that a definite function will be served by having his unconstitutional conviction is -- his conviction held unconstitutional,2,5,25
3391,"because then obviously his position in going to the Governor for a pardon or particularly to the legislature for compensation, and I assure you, that's not that he is interested in, would be vastly improved by a recognition that the decision was unconstitutional, whereas in the present state of the record, there is just the reverse determination by the federal courts",2,5,25
3392,"Yes, sir",0,0,25
3393,"I think that there can be no better last word on this topic than to recognize again that we have more before this bar, before this Court than George Lee Parker",1,8,25
3394,We have George Lee Parker and he's here and I believe his rights are effective,1,8,25
3395,"But as we said by this Court recently in another case, the true proponent before this Court is the Constitution",2,2,25
3396,It has been violated in this case by the State of Texas,2,2,25
3397,It is an honor for me to defend it,2,2,25
3398,And I hope that this Court will decide in favor of it,1,9,25
3399,Thank you,0,0,25
3400,"Thank you, sir",0,0,25
