We should really refer to each other as collections of subatomic particles since that is what we really are.\n\nBut that's not the same thing. Natural/unnatural is categorizing something. 'Human' basically is just a word that summarizes a certain combination of cells. You would need a definition of natural but there's really no good definition. e.g. for natural: 'existing in or derived from nature; not made or caused by humankind.' =&gt; that would mean that humans aren't natural, which implies that a god or aliens or something created us. It rejects evolution.\n'in accordance with the nature of, or circumstances surrounding, someone or something' =&gt; that makes no sense either, who defines what 'in accordance with nature' is?\n\n&gt; If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?\n\nAs I said, it implies an external influence, like god or aliens or something. Most people just use 'unnatural' as a synonym for 'something I disagree with' often in relation to a behavior that is bad for nature (e.g. 'destroying the rain forest is unnatural' but it isn't, it's probably a bad thing for several reasons but humans are selfish because that's the way evolution made us, so it's not unnatural, it's actually very natural).\n\nEDIT: wrote 'natural' instead of 'unnatural' in the last paragraph and changed it",

I want to say most but that may not quite be accurate... there's no prohibition of carrying in most places (and, if memory serves, all states in the union now allow carry, though some so restrictive that they may as well not).  Schools, yes, banned in most places... but movie theaters?  Restaurants?  Malls?  The doctors' office?  For the most part, those of us that carry can and do carry in all those places every single day.\n\nFor example, in my state, there's no prohibition on those places.  What we do have is a situation where if a theater manager, as an example, sees me carrying... well, firstly it means I didn't do *my* job right because I carry *concealed* so if I'm made I blew it... but secondly, all that can happen is he can ask me to leave.  And being a law-abiding citizen, I will without incident because otherwise the police can be called and I'd be subject to criminal trespass charges.  What about signs that are posted saying no guns?  They carry no \"force of law\" here, which means while I can be asked to leave and definitely should, the law says I can be there with my gun.  This isn't an unusual setup, it's true in many states (again, it may even be most at this point).\n\nThe thing is, unless you live in one of the very anti-gun states (the NY, CA, NJ, CT, MA, MD's of the world) you've most likely been around people with guns many times and didn't even know it.  And notice you're still alive none the less! :)  Whether that (not you being alive, the other thing) makes you uncomfortable or not is up to you.

        "t1_cni80dr": "I like to think of it as natural products can be found in nature in the form we use them regularly (without the need for a chemical transformation). If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?\n",

        "t1_cnhpp4o": "&gt; People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural?\n\nWhile you are correct in this line of reasoning. Let me demonstrate how similar lines of reasoning could be used to render many words useless.\n\nHumans are made up of billions of cells, the cells are made up of some number of atoms, and to go further down atoms are made up of quarks (to vastly simplify things a bit). So then why call anything \"human\"? We should really refer to each other as collections of subatomic particles since that is what we really are.\n\nSo what I'm getting at here is the idea that all words - every single one - were invented by humans to explain some kind of phenomena or object. If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?\n\nImagine you're an archaeologist and you're at a site. You pick up an arrowhead from 100 BCE and you declare, \"I have found a natural rock!\" That might confuse your colleagues, especially if some of them are geologists.\n\nSo we use the word \"unnatural\" to differentiate between things made by humans and not made by humans in some contexts.

After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?\n\nBecause it's not useful. \n\nPrimes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. \n\nSo now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause \"Not made by humans\" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people.

Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?

Hence, everything we are and do is simply a product of nature. Something can't be derived from unnatural, when humans created it. This is unless you assume that we were created outside nature (e.g. there was earth/'the nature' and god place us on the planet.

My point is that if you're going to simply lump everything into the natural category and eschew the unnatural one then you could frankly just simplify everything in this way. \"Look at that collection of subatomic particles interacting with that other collection of subatomic particles!\"\n\nWords have subjective meanings, not objective ones.

Many large cities ban concealed firearms regardless of our liberty to own weapons. Most work places ban guns from being on the premise.\n\nRecently there was the [2011 Tucson Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting). I lived right down the road from where it occurred and was involved with police and media due to the relationship of the shooter and the high school he attended. It was a wild minute as the shooter unloaded 33 rounds into the crowd. When he stopped to reload he was assaulted by a bystander with a chair.\n\nThat was in the state of Arizona which is as far conservative and gun toting as it can get. I know many people who pack as if its the wild west. However, these people never seem to be armed at the time of need.\n\nThe right to bear arms is simply gun ownership. In the event of civil war between the people and the government, the people are able to fight back. Where you are able to carry your gun is situational.\n\n[University of Texas Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) was far more situational that would align with the OP's train of thought. A very long drawn out fire fight where police weren't equipped to deal with the gunmen. Citizens with hunting rifles fought back and kept the gunman pinned down as police entered the tower. This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.\n\nFrance has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. \n\nHowever, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring. Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.\n\nAllowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.",

However, the current fad mixes the raw essential oils with other stuff that may or may not be good for you.  The raw essential oils are actually \"a vital resource for drug discovery.\"", 
        "t1_cnhrwsq": "&gt; Human is also categorizing something. Like, \"cat\" also summarizes a certain combination of cells but given that there are a lot of different combinations of cells on Earth it makes sense to categorize them. Human is the term we give them.\n\nYes, but human is easy to define.\n\n&gt; Why would something existing imply that a god or aliens created us?\n\nHumans are derived from nature themselves, at least according to the concept of evolution. Hence, everything we are and do is simply a product of nature. Something can't be derived from unnatural, when humans created it. This is unless you assume that we were created outside nature (e.g. there was earth/'the nature' and god place us on the planet. Or some external force interfered, e.g. aliens manipulated evolution or something crazy like that, then we wouldn't be natural anymore).\n\n&gt; Just because people use words in ways you dislike doesn't mean those words don't have meanings.\n\nIt does have a meaning but not the one people think it has. It doesn't 'good', natural means part of nature and humans are part of nature. It has nothing to do with my opinion, it's simple logic.\n\nbtw. is should say (edited that)\n&gt; Most people just use 'unnatural' as a synonym for 'something I disagree with' often in relation to a behavior that is bad for nature", 
        "t1_cnih9ww": "That is a pretty good overview of the situation. With weapons you either start banning them which results in only criminals having them or you can stri e for a culture of reasonable weapon ownership and carrying, which I think is much better.

They would be only in role of defenders, not chasing down criminals or anything police and SWAT do. They perhaps would rarely be able to stop the first deaths of a mass shooting, but should be more effecting in stopping subsequent deaths.", 
        "t1_cnhkej7": "As much of a proponent of gun rights as I am, history would seem to contradict your claim, since mass shootings occur with some regularity in the United States, where plenty of people do carry, both open and concealed, nearly all of whom have been properly trained.  \n\nHell, someone managed to shoot up the Navy Yard in DC.  I would wager that a few people around there were carrying guns.  \n\nNow, you could use this incident to point out that strict gun laws are obviously incapable of stopping mass shooting events, since one just happened in a place with said laws, but I don't think you can say that more relaxed laws would have stopped it.\n\nI think the lesson to be learned between this AND the United States is that the occurrence of mass shootings is actually pretty independent of a place's gun culture.

        "t1_cnhp0bu": "OK, so, yes, in most cases, essential oils are bullshit when it comes to all this craze about natural healing products and whatnot. But there are some that are SO AWESOME!!! Props to you for being skeptical! Let me see if I can change your view on a couple of oils...\n\nLavender Oil: This is primarily used for relaxation and anxiety relief. There have been several studies performed over many years that have more or less proven this pretty well. I use it myself sometimes after laundering the bedclothes, putting a bit in the pillowcases. I used to foster a really crazy Yorkie, and a tiny dab of the oil on her paws made her unbelievably relaxed and calm.\n\nTea Tree Oil: This is good for minor infections and small wounds. It's endorsed by many doctors, and is even featured on WebMD for these uses (to a lesser extent a LOT of other healing things, but these haven't been studied well.) \n\nPeppermint Oil: While there aren't a lot of conclusive studies available for it, this shit is awesome for digestive issues in my experience when combined with other ingredients. The best medicine I ever had for digestive issues was infused with the stuff. Also, peppermint oil is AMAZING for deterring mosquitoes.\n\nAnyway, the stuff is useful, and typically smells awesome. As long as she isn't destroying her own pocketbook, I think your wife will be fine. The three oils I mentioned (plus a few others) I buy myself at discounts, usually on Amazon, for the uses I mentioned.

I'd also say that making any sort of absolute claim that changes in gun ownership(in either direction) is the primary cause of any shift in crime is pretty statistically dubious.
