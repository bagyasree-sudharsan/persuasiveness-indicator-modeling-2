    "2": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI read with interest and pleasure the tribute to the late Justice Fortas that was recently presented to this Court.\nSolicitor General Lee remarked, that Justice Fortas warned that the Court should be chary of overreaching.\nHe quoted Justice Fortas thusly,\n\"The Courts may be the principal guardians of the liberties of the people. \"\n\"They are not the chief administrators of its economic destiny. \"\nThe government argues in its briefs that they need this material so they can protect the public fist, the public revenue.\nWe have no quarrel with the duty of IRS to collect taxes, but there is nothing to collect here.\nWe are not here to decide the most efficient or the most expeditious way for IRS to collect those taxes.\nI think we are here for a very narrow purpose to decide whether under the facts of Baggot the government may pay sufficient showing to penetrate the historic rule of grand jury secrecy.\nWhat the Court of Appeals did in this case was balance the competing public interests, that of grand jury secrecy against a civil tax examination, and they properly held for grand jury secrecy.\nThe Court recognized that a liberal disclosure policy would facilitate tax collection, but they decided that the interest in grand jury secrecy outweighed that.\nThis case arose, Your Honors, from a letter that was sent by an IRS civil examination head to the United States Attorney, and he requested grand jury testimony--\n--His name was--\n--He was chief of the Civil Audit Division in Chicago, Your Honor.\nWell, no.\nThat is what I am getting to.\nHe requested these grand jury testimony and these documents to determine whether there is civil tax liability.\nThey were going to have an examination to see if there should be a deficiency.\nNo, sir, he was not.\nWell, to be honest with you, what happened is the U. S. Attorney choned this information out of the Civil Tax Audit Division.\nWhat had happened, Your Honor, was there were three different requests for disclosure, all of which were denied by the Court below.\nThen what happened is the United States Attorney transferred over to the chief of the Civil Audit Division matters of public record.\nAnd, there is nothing wrong with that.\nHe sent over the information, the plea sentencing transcript, and the day that they took the plea.\nHe, then, said, oh my goodness, it looks like there might be something here, and he sent a letter back and said, would you please send us anything that you might have that would bear on the civil tax liability of this taxpayer.\nHis letter is appended to our brief, Your Honor.\nBy virtue of the fact that the U. S. Attorney sent the matters of public record to him.\nThey did not have an independent audit going against this taxpayer.\nNow, it is important to remember that the taxpayer, Mr. Baggot, did not plead to any tax-related violation.\nHe plead to two commodity violations, and that information is set forth at page 3A in our appendix.\nThere is no tax-related violation, and the Solicitor General is wrong when he says that there was.\nThere were two commodity violations for bid rigging or what they call wash trades.\nNow, one reason the government does not qualify under the preliminary to exception arises from the unique statutory provisions of IRS.\nCongress provided that IRS has no right or no ability to initiate litigation over a civil tax liability.\nThat right belongs exclusively to the taxpayer.\nEven if IRS wanted to go to court and sue somebody for paying their taxes, they cannot do it by statute.\nThe procedure arises thusly.\nNormally, not in this case, an examination takes place of a return, and IRS decides whether they may compute a proposed deficiency.\nIf they decide there is a proposed deficiency a preliminary notice of that proposed deficiency is sent to the taxpayer, and he then has an opportunity to come in and talk to that examiner and settle or pay, or he can appeal within the IRS administrative procedure to their appeals office.\nIf he is unsuccessful there in negotiating and if he does not want to pay, IRS then issues what is called a 90-day notice of deficiency and that officially determines the amount of the deficiency.\nA letter goes out to the taxpayer, and it says, you owe 90 days to pay it or else.\nThat letter of deficiency, that 90-day--\n--No, sir.\nNo, it is not or go to the Tax Court because if the taxpayer decides not to go to the Tax Court, Justice Blackmun, IRS can go seize his assets.\nBut, what happens with that 90-day letter, that notice of deficiency, it triggers the right of the taxpayer to initiate litigation.\nHe has two choices.\nHe can go to the Tax Court and ask them to redetermine that deficiency, or he can pay the amount owed, then file a suit in the federal district court for a tax refund.\nPardon, sir?\nYes, sir.\nYou are right.\nI was just talking about the triggering of the litigation.\nThe only, as I said, only the taxpayer has the right to file suit and that is because IRS does not have any need for litigation.\nIf the taxpayer does not go to court, the Internal Revenue Service determination is final and an assessment was made.\nNow, the Solicitor General Wallace said, oh, we are here to find out about an assessment.\nWe are a long way of an assessment.\nWe are not any where near an assessment.\nNow, if the taxpayer does not pay what the assessment says, IRS can seize and sell his assets without a court order.\nIn General Motors Leasing, this Court said that a tax assessment is given the force of a judgment.\nNow, here the first step has not been taken yet.\nThere has not been an examination.\nThere is no proposed deficiency.\nThere is no notice of deficiency, and there is no assessment.\nAll we have is the desire, the bear, naked desire of IRS to see if there is a tax liability.\nNow, the government motion here sought disclosure for use preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding relating to the tax liability of the Respondent.\nThere is no tax liability.\nThere is not even a proposed tax liability.\nThe Seventh Circuit, I think, rightly held that Mr. Baggot's possible tax liability was too embryonic, was too speculative, and was too uncertain--\n--I would certainly hope that I would know about mine, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI suppose that is possible under certain interpretations that IRS might make, yes sir.\nAt least suggested.\nWe do not even have that, Your Honor.\nAs I say, I suppose that is possible.\nBut that is certainly--\n--Yes, sir.\nI understand, and I agree with that, but that is certainly not our situation here.\nAt best we have--\n--Yes, sir.\nIn that regard... Now, there was a dissent in this case by Judge Pell, and I am willing to accept the definitions that Judge Pell gave for preliminary to.\nHe said, preceding the main business or lying before, or leading to.\nNow, I suggest to the Court that the main business of a tax examination is the calculation of a deficiency.\nThat is not a judicial proceeding.\nThe calculation is an administrative function, and it is not preparatory to a law suit.\nFirst of all, I would correct you because when you say continue to investigate, they have not conducted any investigation of this taxpayer.\nThey first made their request for these materials in March of 1978.\nThat is over five years ago, Your Honor.\nAnd, they have not yet conducted their own investigation, and I am getting to their power.\nThey have enormous power--\n--I will get specifically to your question.\nIt is cited in our brief, Professor LaFave testified before the House Committee that was considering the 1977 amendments to the 6(e) rule, and the concern was not as Solicitor Wallace says, the concern was if we give administrative agencies this information for criminal purposes as they are allowed to do, the concern was that there would be leakage back to those agencies so that they would use it for unrelated civil purposes.\nWhen questioned about that, Professor LaFave said unless it was a matter most critical to their undertaking and unless they could demonstrate that they had no other comparable way of obtaining this evidence, they could not get to the evidence under the preliminary to exception.\nYes, sir.\nI think it is a two-prong test.\nNumber one, is it preliminarily to, which involves the balancing of a competing interest among other things, and the second test is particularized need, which has been set forth by this Court.\nI do not know if ever, Your Honor.\nThat is what I am saying.\nI suppose... I do not want to say that the preliminary--\n--No, sir, but I think at a minimum they would have to use their own investigative procedures--\n--They have done nothing in this case, and--\n--I do not know when that is, Your Honor.\nI do not know when that is.\nI don't think that we can... I think we can--\n--Certainly not in this stage, and I do not think--\n--That is right, Your Honor.\nPerhaps--\n--I would say yes.\nThat would be in connection with--\n--I would not say never because, I was taught a long time ago that that is a bad, bad word--\n[Laughter]\nYes, sir.\nNot under those facts alone.\nIf they see that in the newspaper, they can certainly start their own Internal Revenue Service investigation.\nThey have massive powers.\nThey have subpoena powers--\n--If there were grand jury minutes in that case, I do not think they could go for them unless they have shown that they have used their own powers.\nIf you are talking, Your Honor, about a criminal case, they can have them.\nBut, you said he plead guilty to embezzlement, not to income tax violations.\nIf we are talking about civil purposes, the primary reason for the grand jury, and it is in the Fifth Amendment, is that it is an accusatory body to bring criminal matters, felony criminal matters.\nIt is not to be used for civil matters.\nThis Court said in Proctor & Gamble, it would be flouting the purpose of the law if it were used solely for civil matters.\nI will go along with Justice White who asked Solicitor General--\n--I understand that.\nThat is over with, but they still had no right to those grand jury minutes.\nWhat they do if they do that is they circumscribe the intent of Congress when it is an improper use of the grand jury.\nIf there is a criminal case, Your Honor, the matter becomes public knowledge.\nThere is testimony.\nIt is public knowledge--\n--Okay, and I am suggesting incipiency is not enough.\nI think at a minimum you need a controversy, a case or a controversy at the administrative level.\nAt the administrative level, under that you really have nothing.\nIn your mind you know pretty well if this guy only reported $2.50, he has got a big tax liability if he embezzled a million.\nBut, technically as far as the Rule is concerned, as far as IRS procedures are concerned, there is nothing determined until there is a notice of deficiency.\nNo, sir.\nNo, sir.\nIf the work papers are the direct product of the grand jury, I would still stick to my answer.\nNo, sir, Justice Marshall.\nIf the work papers are generated outside of the grand jury, yes, they can get them.\nYes, ma'am.\nYes.\nI do not think we can draw a bright-line test.\nI have thought a great deal about this.\nThe easy answer, I think, is if you file a deficiency notice that should be a sufficient time for them to come in and say it is preliminary to.\nBut, what I think will happen if this Court establishes that kind of test is IRS will run right around end.\nAnd, they will crank out... it will be an open invitation for them to crank out deficiency notices just like popcorn.\nSo, I think what you have to do is take it on a case-by-case basis, use the flexibility of the court.\nIt is a discretionary matter... 6(e) is a discretionary matter.\nIt is not mandatory, and I think you have to talk about the tests that were set forth in Douglas Oil and balance the competing interest against the relevant circumstances and against the standards that were set and see if--\n--Yes, sir.\nAs I say, I do not think you can establish a bright-line test here.\nJustice O'Connor, I think my answer lies with Congress and they way that they set forth that statute.\nNo, I do not, because the Seventh Circuit said that they would not fashion a special judicial exception to 6(e) for the benefit of IRS.\nAnd, that is what the government is asking you to do here.\nAnd, Justice White put his finger on it in his question earlier.\nThey are not saying, well at this point we have established preliminary to.\nThey are saying everything is preliminary to.\nThey are asking for automatic access.\nNo, sir, what I am saying is that what Congress said because of--\n--Yes.\nWhat they said, number one, it takes a court order.\nNumber two, they said they did not want any leakage back.\nNumber three, they said--\n--Oh, yes, you can.\nThat is what the Rule says, Your Honor.\nThat is what the Rule says.\nYou can have disclosure preliminary to or in connection with.\nYes, sir.\nNo, I am saying that that stage may be reached at some critical stage within IRS procedures, but I cannot define... but we certainly have not reached it in Baggot.\nYes, sir.\nYour Honor, I am not qualified to speak to the facts of Sells.\nBut, again, never is a bad word.\nI think if the Civil Division, one, showed that it was preliminary to, and number two showed a particularized need--\n--Then, I do not think that is sufficient.\nAn investigation is not sufficient.\nJustice O'Connor, you are getting me into the Sells case, and I do not know the Sells case.\nThe only thing I know about Sells is that if this Court accepts any lessened standard of particularized need that they opt for in Sells, i.e. rationally related, and if this Court adopts the position that they are taking here and giving administrative agencies automatic access to grand jury materials, you signal the death bell of the grand jury because there would be no more secrecy at all.\nSecrecy will be gone, and the vital function of the grand jury as a criminal accusatory body in the criminal justice system will be devastated.\nYes, sir.\nI think--\n--I think the law will be changed.\nThe practice will change.\nFifty percent of the test for disclosure is gone.\n--the preliminary to.\nThe judge's action below will be purely ministerial.\nThey want automatic access.\nThey will render the--\n--I am not sure what you have.\nIf you are talking about what he says, oh, it has been routine and we have done this all.\nYour Honor, that is certainly not true.\nHe talked about Judge Becker, and what I suggest you do is look at the Pflaumer case and look at the Hawthorne case, both of which were written by Judge Becker--\n--No, I did not say Judge Becker was wrong.\nJust hear me out, please.\nIf you remember, Justice Stevens asked Mr. Wallace can you document it.\nAnd he said, no we cannot.\nJudge Becker agonized over those two decisions.\nHe talked about how unclear 6(e) was.\nHe asked this Court to clear up the confusion created by 6(e), and that is what lead to the 1977 amendments.\nAnd those 1977 amendments said, yes, give it to IRS for criminal purposes, but when that access is gone, it stays with the U. S. Attorney and they have to come in for an order under the preliminary to or connection with exception before they can have any of this material.\nThat was the whole purpose of the 1977 amendment, and there was not any routine disclosure at all.\nThe preliminary to rule has remained unchanged since it was promulgated in 1946.\nMr. Wallace is right when he says there is nothing in the history or nothing in the Advisory notes that gives you any indication what Congress thought about.\nAll they said in the Advisory notes is we intend to continue the traditional practice of grand jury secrecy.\nAnd I suggest to this Court... and they cited three cases, none of which had anything to do with disclosure to an administrative agency.\nAnd, I suggest to this Court that the traditional practice of grand jury secrecy did not include turning the stuff over to IRS to use for civil purposes.\nIf it did, it was changed by the 1977 amendment.\nNo, sir.\nThat is right.\nEven in Judge Becker's--\n--Your Honor, even in Judge Becker's opinion in Hawthorne, which the government relies on, he said if the IRS... and we are talking about IRS there... had access for criminal purposes, their future access... those were his words... would follow as though there had been no access at all.\nThat gets difficult, and the Chief Justice asked a question earlier.\nHe said, well how can he take it out of this side of their mind and put it over in the other side of their mind.\nAnd, the quick answer is, they cannot, but I think Congress was trying to do the best they could to see that they would so there would not be any abusive practices in the grand jury.\nAnother thing I would like to speak to is he said his experience is that U. S. Attorneys cannot be manipulated.\nI was a federal prosecutor, both with the Anti-trust Division and the Strike Force for ten years, and I have been handling grand jury matters for another 18 years.\nManipulation is as easy as an IRS saying to the United States Attorney, subpoena the records from this bank.\nIt may have nothing to do with his Title 18 investigation, but it would certainly help the civil investigation.\nAs a normal matter, a U. S. Attorney could care less, and I use that very advisedly, about tax violations.\nHe is interested in Title 18 violations.\nFor example, let's take an extortion case, or let's take a bribery case.\nHis questions are who did you pay, and how much did you pay him, and why did you pay him.\nIf a witness knows that IRS is going to be listening at the door and get all of those grand jury secrets, he is going to be very reluctant to speak, and that goes to the fourth reason for secrecy, the impact on the testimony of witnesses should be full and frank.\nBecause he does not have any problem saying maybe, or at least he has reached a point saying, alright I am involved in a crime, and I will tell you about this bribery.\nI paid this public official.\nBut, if he thinks IRS is going to carry his house and his car away, he is going to be very reluctant to talk about that.\nAnd, that holds over to all grand jury actions that involve money.\nWhat you are doing is giving IRS a partnership in the grand jury proceeding, and I suggest that traditional grand jury history and secrecy as set forth by this Court in many, many cases, Colandra and U. S. v. Johnson, Blair, and Proctor & Gamble, and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, never contemplated such a thing.\nLet me make one more point.\nGeneral Motors filed an amicus brief here, and if you will look... I have the page marked, but I cannot... there is a long footnote, I think it is page... it is footnote 18.\nIRS asked General Motors for all kinds of documents, and they said, we will give them to you.\nWe kept copies.\nYou do not need a 6(e) order.\nHere you are government--\n--Thank you, Your Honor.",

    "4": "If the Court please, this case is here on petition of -- for certiorari for the examination of two questions decided in the first instance by the National Labor Relations Board and affirmed on appeal by the Second Circuit.\nThe two questions will designate, first, the loss of status question that arises under Section 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, which we'll advert to at more length in a few moments.\nThe second question which was allowed on the petition for the writ was the contract question, that is, whether the Board properly found that the strike involved in this issue -- in this proceeding was not a violation of a no-strike commitment made in a contract by one of the unions involved.\nNow, I'm going to make a rather brief truncated statement of the facts because that is all that's required to raise the strict issues of law here.\nHowever, I may, later on in the argument, advert to certain facts which I do not state at this time not because I think that there are necessary to raise the issues, but because they may throw some light on the reasons why Congress undertook to an Act as brought an Act as it did here.\nThe petitioner, to get on with the facts, operates a plant in New York City.\nIn 1949, it entered into a collective bargaining contract with a union, Local 22045, a federal union of the American Federation of Labor which, then, was unquestionably the representative of the employees concerned.\nThat contract contained a no-strike clause, the language of which we will get to in its appropriate place.\nThe contract was about half expired when, in August of 1950, a CIO union, Local 65 of the Merchandise Workers, I believe it is, made an organizational attack on the plant and it met with a good deal of success, at least sufficient to enable it to file a petition for recognition for the National Labor Relations Board in the latter part of September.\nMeanwhile, the incumbent union, Local 22045, had demanded on about September 7th, some weeks before its 60-day renewal period of its contract approached, an increase of wages in the amount of 12-and-a half cents per hour, and that was all.\nThe petitioner here was admittedly concerned with the reputation of the assaulting union, Local 65, as being inflicted or infiltrated with Communism, which he opposed.\nHe proposed, therefore, to the incumbent union that they join together to take steps to combat the rating union, Local 65.\nThey believed, however, that the incumbent was a bit too weak to cope with the situation and, so, he got in touch with another union, a Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.\nAnd, he sought to induce the incumbent, Local 22045, to turn over the bargaining agency to this Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.\nThat attempt to induce a voluntary turnover of the agency failed and it is found, and we do not now deny before this Court, that the petitioner, thereupon, committed a series of unfair labor practices which may be summed up as supporting an organizational drive in support of Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.\nThere was one additional unfair labor practice to which I'll advert in a moment.\nIn October of 1950, we have this situation then that the representation proceeding was pending.\nThe employer supported, and which Board -- the Board properly held to be an unfair labor practice, an organizational drive to unseat the bargaining agent.\nAnd, the bargaining agent itself reacted by upping its demands to 25 cents per hour and including a demand for a welfare fund.\nAt some later point, in the dealings between then and the time of the strike which I'm about to come to, Local 22045 concluded that it itself wished to transfer its bargaining rights to the Carpenters Union, a Local 3127.\nThe reason why it said it wanted to do that was because the bargaining -- because the Carpenters Union was equipped to administer the welfare fund which it had demanded, and it itself was not.\nWe come down to November 10th, then, with the situation of three, at least, contending interests on the union's side, Local 65, Local 318, and this hybrid Local 22045-3127.\nOn November 10th, there was an employee by the name of Ciccone, employed in the machine shop, and he had, unquestionably, been soliciting on behalf of the 22045-3127 combination.\nWe are in no position to contest that at this level.\nLet me distinguish on your use of the word \"caused\".\nI will admit that the employees struck in response to the unfair labor practices.\nThat is as far as I will admit to a chain of causation.\nThe Court's findings paralleled the Board precisely.\nThey -- paralleled the Boards precisely.\nThe Board found that -- its terminology was that the unfair labor practice is caused.\nWell, there is a distinction between the scientific notion, of course, in the sense in which the Board used it.\nI -- I said that the Board found that strike was caused by the unfair labor practices.\nNow, that does not mean, and the Board did not intend to find, that this employer physically ousted these people from the premises wherefore they're being divorced from their occupation, there was a strike.\nIt will not be, I think, Your Honor, as we proceed with the argument.\nThere is an argument, when I get to the contract phase of this, advanced by my opponent on which I think you will find that it may be quite material.\nWell, the Board draws a conclusion --\nLet me anticipate it.\nThe Board -- the Board draws a conclusion or, rather, counsel for the Board draws a conclusion which is, I think, supported by the Board's own opinion of the case, and his conclusion is this.\nThat you cannot assert, as a defense, your no-strike clause for the reason that the strike was caused by unfair labor practices and you cannot take advantage of your own wrong.\nNow, we would say that if \u201ccourse\u201d were used in the absolute scientific sense by the Board, that that would be valid.\nHowever, intervening between the unfair labor practice, which is the stated cause, and the result which is the strike, you have the voluntary action of the strikers.\nThey don't have to strike.\nNobody forced them to strike.\nThe strike wasn't caused in the scientific sense.\nI would say that, in this precise connection, if there were such a connection between the asserted cause and the asserted result that one inevitably flowed from the other, the connection would be scientific, but they are voluntary intervening acts of parties not under the control of the petitioner.\nAnd, I say that when the Board says the strike was caused by the unfair labor practices, we will admit that but only in the sense that the strike action was taken voluntarily in response to the unfair labor practices which were committed.\nOn November 10th, then, Ciccone is employed in the machine shop.\nHe is distributing literature or soliciting signatures on behalf of the -- let's call it the incumbent Carpenters Union.\nI think for all practical purposes, we may assume that the incumbent and the Carpenters Union were one and the same.\nThey had the same officers, same offices, and one appeared to be the alter ego of the other.\nThey have been so treated below.\nThe president of the petitioner tells him to stop his duties which were of a roving character and confine his activities to the machine shop for the balance of that day.\nThe president's -- the president of the petitioner was going downtown to a Board of Directors meeting.\nAt about -- that was about noon time.\nAt somewhere around the hour of 3 o'clock that afternoon, it was reported to the president who had called into the plant over the telephone that Ciccone was out of his department, he ordered Ciccone fired, the rest of the machine shop stopped within 10 minutes after the firing of Ciccone.\nSome other departments stropped within, let's say, a half-hour after that.\nThe balance of the plant continued working that day, including the night shift which came on later but, the following morning, there was a picket line -- I should say, a picket line was established outside that afternoon rather quickly.\nAnd, the following morning, there picket line continued under the auspices of the Carpenters Union, Local 3127 and the plant, for all practical purposes, was down and on a strike.\nThat was November 11th.\nThe plant did not resume operation until December 11th.\nAnd, at that time, all who did not return to work, some-70 odd in number who are the dischargees which are the subject of this order, were discharged by the company and they have never been reinstated.\nNow, they are the underlying facts.\nThere were two defenses asserted by petitioner below.\nAnd, the first of these was that the employees involved strikers, which are the subject and the reinstatement order, had lost their status under Section 8 (d) of the Act.\nOne of the phrases in -- in Section 8 (d) is \u201cany employee who strikes\u201d -- I'm sorry.\nOh yes, they made a bid for reinstatement but not until March of the succeeding year.\nAnd, there is no question that none of them -- that any of them has ever been reemployed.\nThe specific portion of the Act involved -- reads, \u201cany employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Section 8, 9, and 10 of this Act as amended.\nBut, such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer.\u201d\nNow, it is not enough for me merely to read that.\nI will summarize what goes before.\nThat appears in a Section, 8 (d), which is basically designed to define what collective bargaining is, and it gives, in the forepart of the section, a generic definition of collective bargaining.\nAnd, in the latter part of the section under a proviso clause, it gives a definition of what collective bargaining consists of where there is in existence a contract.\nRoughly, that runs, provided that where there is, in effect, a collective bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification takes several steps.\nAmong which, are notifies the other party to the contract that it desires the termination 60-days prior to the termination desired, notifies the mediation service 30 days thereafter of the continued existence of a labor dispute, offers to meet and confer with the other party on the terms of the renewal.\nAnd, finally, continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lockout, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of 60 days after such notice as -- is given or until the expiration of such contract, whichever occurs later.\nNow, then, with some intervening matter of no immediate consequence, we find the loss-of-status clause, which goes on as I read before, \u201cany employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period, and specified in this subsection, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Section 8, 9, and 10 of the Act.\u201d\nNow, that defense was asserted below, that is, we said these employees struck within that 60-day period.\nA notice of termination had been served on October 10th, 1950.\nThat would have made a 60-day period extending from October 10th to December 10th.\nThe strike here occurred on the 10th of November and continued thereafter.\nWe said, therefore, these employees have lost status.\nThe Board has no jurisdiction to enter the order which it has entered here because none of the subjects of that order are employees within the meaning of the Act, having lost that status.\nNow, the treatment of our objection and defense by the Board was this, and I must admit that I can't quite say what the scope of the decisions below is.\nThe Board says, \u201cwell, Congresses\u201d --\nThere is not.\nSo, the only sanction on the employer in these premises is the entry against him of an unfair labor practice order.\nThat is a cease and desist order which may, of course, incorporate reinstatement of back-pay.\nThe employer is guilty of an unfair labor practice.\nNow, the -- the union terminating a contract in disregard of the specified procedures is also guilty of an unfair labor practice, but the terminal sentence of the clause refers not to unions, not to employers, but to individual employees.\nIt says \u201cany employee.\u201d\nI'll expatiate on the language later on.\nHe loses his remedy before the Board.\nThat's --\nHe doesn't --\n-- participate in the strike.\nHe forfeits nothing, sir.\nSo that, the possibility is that --\nHe might have been reinstated.\nOh yes.\nOh yes.\nHe has the full panoply of Board remedies.\nHe can --\nHe can go in and file a charge and procure reinstatement with back-pay.\nBefore the Board.\nMr. Manoli would be a better expert on that than I.\nIt would not be quite as expeditious.\nLet's say, as an equity remedy, I conceive that.\nIt has taken months, I will also conceive that.\nIt has never taken less than months, to my knowledge, except in the case of informal adjustments.\nNow, there are a lot of them that go on before the Board, under its ages after the filing of a charge.\nThere is a considerable degree of adjustments undertaken by the Board.\nAnd, maybe that it is only the cases which warrant a trial which go to trial.\nI am not in a statistical position to answer that one.\nLet me pick up now.\nThe treatment of these objections below, I said I was a little bit uncertain as to just how far the Board and/or the court below wanted to go.\nThey say that the loss-of-status clause is a part of the section as a whole and, of course, no one can gain to say that.\nAnd, they say the section as a whole is devoted to the problem of termination or modification of a contract.\nIt specifies the method whereby collective contracts ought to be terminated and modified.\nTherefore, the loss-of-status clause, although its language, nobody disputes that its literal language supports the construction of petitioner here, although its language is broad, its intent must be narrowed by the obligations laid upon the parties in the foregoing part of the section.\nTherefore, when we have a strike question before us, under the loss-of-status clause, the question becomes, is it a strike to terminate or modify a contract?\nNow, I've said that I was a little dubious as to whether that was only the holding below or whether the holding was to be narrowed a little bit.\nThe language used is susceptible of the interpretation that only unfair labor practice strikes are excluded by the Board in -- under its rule.\nI think the Board, perhaps, was a little bit more clear on that, and I would be inclined to say that what the Board held was that only a strike designed to terminate or modify a contract would be held to be a strike within the purview of the loss-of-status clause.\nNow, that leaves a number of strikes which are completely in the neutral ground, for instance, a strike to procure recognition.\nLet's say that there is an incumbent bargaining agent that a foreign union, such as Local 65 in this case, came in but, instead of adopting the feasible procedures of the Board, suppose it said to the employer, \u201cWe want you to recognize us.\u201d\nAnd, the employer said, \u201cNo, I won't recognize you.\nLook, I've got an incumbent union.\u201d\nAnd, Local 65 said, \u201cWe'll strike.\u201d\nWell, it might well be that they would be in a position to make that strike effective whether or not they represented the majority.\nUnder the Board rule, as I read it to my best judgment, the Board would say that such a strike, again, is not within the ambit of the loss-of-status clause.\nIn other words, the striking employees in that case would work no forfeiture of there remedies upon themselves.\nThe Second Circuit, I think, was a little bit more cloudy in its construction.\nI don't think it knew quite whether it wanted to hold the position that I've just described or whether it merely wanted to see that unfair labor practice strikers were not denied the remedies prescribed for them in the Act by virtue of the loss-of-status clause.\nThe situation there was that, between the time we had got the Board decision and the time the Circuit Court of Appeals heard our argument in the -- on this case, the Eighth Circuit had decided Local 3, United Packing House Workers against NLRB, that was the Wilson & Company case.\nAnd, the Board had predicated much of its opinion in our case on the Wilson case.\nBut, by the time we got in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Eighth Circuit had reversed the Board on the Wilson doctrine.\nAnd, that left the Second Circuit rather hanging in midair.\nAnd, so, it finally came to the conclusion that perhaps there is a distinction between the Local 3 case and this one lying in the fact that, here, we have unfair labor practices antecedent to the strike, and in the Local 3 case there were no such antecedent unfair labor practices.\nNow, let me argue the point.\nI've already adverted to the observation that there is really no fact question underlying the defense.\nEverybody concedes that the strike occurred within the prohibited time.\nEverybody concede that none of these employees has been reemployed so as to restore his rights, nor is there any question that, if the words of the loss-of-status clause be given their literal meaning, the defense should be upheld.\nThe question relates solely to whether is -- whether the literal meaning is the meaning to be adopted or whether that meaning is to be modified by something else in the section or in the Act.\nNow, let me call the Court's attention to the language of Congress that we are going to look at.\nAny employees starts off with, \u201cany\u201d is a term of universality.\nIt is put there to broaden deliberately the ambit of employees to whom this is to apply, \u201cany employee.\u201d\nNow, you'll notice later in the wording, any employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period, and so forth, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute.\nNow, those words, particularly \u201cof the employer engaged in this particular dispute,\u201d are an aversion by Congress to the basic definition of employer which is contained in two-three of the Act, in which it says the term \u201cemployee\u201d shall include any employee and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer unless the Act explicitly states otherwise.\nHere, the section is explicitly stating otherwise.\nAnd, you will notice that two-three goes on further to include any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of or in connection with or because of any unfair labor practice, and we seek to draw from that, from the particular aversion to that definition.\nThis, that the Congress, when it rejected a particular implication of that definition, accepted what remained and what remained was a definition which included an employee whose work had ceased in connection with or as -- as a result of an unfair labor practice.\nNow, let's go further into the language here.\nAny employee who engages in a strike, take the word, \"strike.\"\nThat is a word which has a statutory definition.\nSection 501 of the Labor Management Relations Act which amended the Wagner Act contains a specific definition of \u201cstrike\u201d which, again, contains the broad term, \"any strike.\"\nNow, not only does it refer to any strike, but that section gives internal evidence of having been drawn precisely with the contract renewal problem in mind for one of the inclusions in that definition is, specifically, the no contract-no work strike which Mr. John L. Lewis made famous several years before the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act.\nThat's further made clear by Section 502 which follows it, which excludes safety strikes as rather narrowly defined.\nThey define a safety strike as a strike occurring by reason of the immediate presence of danger at the status of the operation.\nSo that, we know that Congress, when it was dealing with this problem, had fully in mind the problem of whether they wanted to exclude strikes on a qualitative basis or on a temporal basis.\nLet's return again to the provisions of the specific loss-of-status clause.\nAny employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period.\nNow, that is clearly a temporal standard of conduct.\nThere is nothing qualitative about it at all.\nIt's measured exclusively as a period of time.\nNow, did Congress mean that?\nWe have some evidence that it did.\nThe language of the loss-of-status clause came out of the Senate version of the bill, S.1126.\nAs it originally appeared in that bill, the loss-of-status clause didn't say within the 60-day period.\nIt said prior to the expiration of the 60-day period.\nThat version of the bill obtained through the initial report and through its inclusion by the Senate in the bill which went to Conference, and it was changed only by the Conference Committee.\nNow, we have further evidence along the same line.\nEvery reference to this in the commissioner -- in the committee reports, and there are only two of them, I have collated them in an appendix to the reply brief, refers exclusively to a temporal basis.\nThere is no suggestion anywhere that a qualitative measure of conduct was intended by Congress, all quantitative temporal, within the 60-day period.\nNow, at this point, you'd have to assume, if you wanted to follow the Board construction, that Congress made at least three independent language errors.\nNow, the assumption that Congress made three independent language errors in a very short sentence is rather farfetched.\nAnd, I think if we will examine this section further, we'll see that Congress was not erring at all, but Congress was dealing with a separate facet of the renegotiation problem.\nLet's go on with the wording, any employee who engages on a strike within the 60-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Sections 8, 9, and 10 of this Act.\nNow, Your Honors will notice that there is no condemnation of the conduct of the person who strikes within this 60-day period.\nThis loss-of-status clause does not say that a strike within the 60-day period is unlawful.\nIt doesn't attempt to characterize the conduct to say that, just because you strike within the 60-day period, you are committing a misdemeanor or some sort rather or you are -- you are committing conduct which should be punished.\nIt doesn't say anything of that sort.\nIt deals solely with the status of the employee under the remedial sections of the Act, those are Sections 8, 9, and 10.\nIt says, nothing whatever about his status under Section 7 of the Act, which is the substantive section giving him the right to organize and bargain collectively and to engage in other concerted activities.\nIt leaves that section -- his rights under that Section complete.\nOf course, a certain number of men, to a certain degree -- to a certain extent and to a certain degree, they are unenforceable because the remedial Sections 8, 9, and 10 are being denied to him by this Section.\nNow, what is the significance of that selective language?\nLet's take Section 9.\nHe's barred from his rights under Section 9.\nThat means that he can't be a protagonist in a representation proceeding brought before the Board.\nHe can't be a voter in its elections.\nHe can't be a respond -- a party respondent to a proceeding bought -- brought by another.\nHe's completely divorced from a representation proceeding.\nIt's the literal language of this before us.\nNow, why should that be so?\nUnless Congress had contemplated that organizational difficulties, representation questions, might be pending at or about the time of contract renewal.\nCongress knew that very well.\nCongress, in enacting this situation or enacting this whole section allowing 60 days for renegotiation, was quite cognizant of the contract bar doctrine of the Board which permitted questions from being -- representation questions from being raised until pretty near the 60th day prior to the expiration of a contract.\nIt knew that representation proceedings would be pending during, rather, in a certain number of the cases which would fall under this section of the Act.\nTherefore, we may infer that Congress had in mind denying a striker who went out on a recognition strike, a status in the type of proceeding which a recognition -- which a representation proceeding would be designed to circumvent.\nAll right, that's Section 9.\nNow, they bar him also from Section 8.\nSection 8 is the section which defines what an unfair labor practice is.\nUnder the old Wagner Act, it was unilateral in finding the employer only.\nToday, it's bilateral.\nWhy does the Congress bar an employee from access to Section 8?\nUnless it presupposes that he has been the victim of an unfair labor practice or that he will be the victim of an unfair labor practice.\nThe very relief that it denies to it is the relief that he would need when, and only when, he had been ousted from his job, demoted, or been the victim of some other discrimination where he would need the Board to lift him up again and reinstate him in his former place.\nNow, of course, we also have Section 10.\nSection 10 is the procedural section.\nThat's the section under which he goes to the Board, files a charge, the Board issues a complaint, has a hearing, makes a finding, issues, and order.\nNow, there is no point to putting in a denial of relief under Section 10, unless the Board was aiming at the unfair labor practice at -- at knocking out the employee's -- the strikers' access for unfair labor practices which had been committed prior to the strike and which were pending undetermined before the man hit the breaks, as the saying goes.\nSection 10 appears to have been put there precisely to block the contention that the loss-of-status clause does not apply to antecedent unfair labor practices.\nWhat Congress has done under this section -- Your -- Your Honors will further notice that the concluding words of the section restore the man's loss-of-status immediately upon reemployment.\nNow, let me equate what Congress has done here to the notion that we have in other fields of law of an election of remedies.\nCongress hasn't said this conduct of striking is wrong.\nIt merely says \u201cwe buy your remedy.\u201d\nYou have a choice.\nYou may have a remedy by strike or you may have a remedy by the processes of the Board, but you cannot have both in these circumstances.\nIf you think that a strike is an efficacious remedy for your problem, you may go ahead and strike.\nWe don't condemn your action.\nWe say not a word about it being unlawful.\nWe don't make it an unfair labor practice.\nNobody consents you, but you can't go to the Board.\nYou can't ride the two horses at once.\nIf your strike interferes with renegotiation, however, and you have -- and your strike was the wrong remedy, we will leave you precisely where we found you.\nWe will not, again, put you in a position to resort to the remedy which you thought was so slow or inefficacious that you disregarded it in favor of a strike.\nIn other words, you may follow the ways of peace and, if you do, you have your full rights before the Board.\nOn the other hand, you may disrupt negotiation.\nAnd, that refers not only to the incumbent bargaining union, but to the contesters, to the other unions, to political factions within the incumbent union, to anyone who, for his own designs and for his own purposes, whether or not those designs and purposes accord with those of the incumbent union, loses the remedy.\nIt would have its choice.\nStill it -- it would still have its choice between the strike and the Board remedy.\nThe --\n-- the -- your statement -- Your Honor's statement, of course with the facts of this case, the unfair labor practices or the both of them because they brought them in --\n-- after the service of the notice.\nThat's right.\nIf they -- they have the election to strike or to accept the Board remedy.\nOh no, sir.\nI -- you --\n-- misunderstood me then.\nOh I -- I see what you mean.\nNo, you did not misunderstand me.\nBefore this notice is given, --\n-- an unfair labor practice strike --\n-- may be remedied by the Board.\nAnd, it may also exist as a strike.\nIn other words, --\n-- the Union has the full panoply of war material, shall we say.\nIt has two lawful choices --\n-- prior to the service of the notice.\nWell, it -- it has -- it still has its election.\nBut, now, its election is conditioned on a forfeiture of its right --\n-- to --\nYes -- no, its choice now becomes restricted.\nIt cannot do both.\nIt may resort to --\n-- only to the Board, if it wishes to resort to the Board.\nIf it resorts to the strike, it may not thereafter resort to the Board.\nLet us -- let me make this observation in answer to that.\nThere is distinct evidence that this is one of two sections of the Taft-Hartley Act which was enacted not for the protection of the employer, nor for the protection of the employee, nor for the protection of the union, but for the protection of the public.\nSenator Ball, one of the sponsors of the Act that's admitted by opposition, as a matter of fact, they originally lean on him, said -- identified this as one of two such provisions, the other one being the national emergency provision.\nNow, from that view point, what is Congress interested in?\nCongress is interested in a smooth renegotiation of contracts.\nIt's not taking the narrow view of equity between employer and employee, or between union and employee.\nIt's taken the view point that all interfering strikes should be controlled during this period.\nThat is so, sir, but this is a specific application of it.\nI think -- I think that Congress had a bit more confidence in the Board than Your Honor's question implies.\nThat is right, sir, but this Court has, only within the last term and I think on two occasions, rather than one, rejected a rather well founded argument that was brought up based upon jurisdiction acquired as a result of the procedural delays of some other body.\nIf I recall the Garner case, they came up here with one of the judges of the Pennsylvania Court thinking that the Garner brothers had no adequate remedy by reason of the length of time that it took a proceeding to go through the various stages which such a proceeding goes through with the Board which, incidentally, were about the same as they are here, I believe.\nThis Court, in deciding the Garner case, didn't even take notice of that objection.\nAnd, I think, rather recently, I don't recall the case you have.\nWe objected the argument expressly, as it was presented in another case.\nIt might have been the Western council, although I'm not quite sure now.\nLet me reemphasize, in the minute or two that I have remaining, that what Congress was trying to achieve here was, as Your Honor put it, industrial peace during this renegotiation period which is a critical period.\nNow, you do not achieve industrial peace simply by commanding two people to bargain.\nYou must do more than that.\nYou must prevent any interfering force which may be applied.\nIf a third-party, not a party to the contract at all, comes in and says, \u201cWe want something else than is being bargained for.\nWe will strike together,\u201d the actions of that party must be controlled.\nHow can the parties who are suppose to bargain continue to bargain if the plants about which they are bargaining are on strike for any reason?\nLet me remind --\n-- Your Honor that a union, as such, has no rights under this Act.\nWhat Acts -- what rights it has under the theory of this Act in its predecessor and of the Railway Labor Act are not the rights of the union but the right of the employee.\nThey are completely derivative and dependent upon their existence.\nRather, they depend completely upon the will of the individual employee.\nNow, the will of the individual employee may quite -- may well, it is true, be swayed even by an employer today, strange as that may seem.\nBut, Congress, in enacting this Act, it seems to me, decided to subordinate certain of the protections and its right apparent on the face of the enactment which it had previously given in order to achieve industrial peace during the critical time of renegotiation.\nAnd, I think that the breath of this language we have before us today completely supports such a purpose on the part of Congress.\nI see I'm not going to be able to get to my -- rest of my argument.\nWell, I'm not going to be able to cover the -- I'd -- I'd sooner hold that --\nI can't --\n-- possibly cover the contract points in five minutes.\nI can't add very much to what Mr. Manoli said in answer to Mr. Justice Black's question.\nAs far as I know, the bill was originally reported, the language originally appeared in S.1126 as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor to the body.\nIn that form, it was a second proviso clause, that is, the section first to find what collective bargaining was generally.\nThen, it says \u201cprovided that where there is a contract, these obligations follow,\u201d and then, at the tail end, in the same position that it is now, it said \u201cprovided, further, that any employee who strikes during this period shall fall from the status,\u201d using substantially the words of their mouth.\nAs it was report --\nIt was offered in the Senate by -- it was a committee bill as originally offered in the Senate.\nI do not know whether it appeared in any of the antecedent bills which went into the makeup of 1126.\nI would like also to comment a moment on, perhaps a little differing concept evoked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question to Mr. Manoli, concerning the relationship between the contract issue and the loss of status issue.\nI would think that the logical way for this Court to approach the problem would be to consider, first, the loss of status issue because, apparently, that goes to the jurisdiction of the Board.\nIf there are no employees, the Board has no jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding, and the effect of this loss of status clause is to rob these men of whatever status they had as employees.\nI would think that it was rather an absurdity to have the National Labor Relations Board conduct a proceeding to determine whether there were unfair labor practices in order to determine whether or not it had jurisdiction to determine whether there were unfair labor practices.\nI would like to say, further, concerning my little passages arms with the Chief Justice, that the arguments used by the Chief Justice were the arguments used in some part by the minority in attacking this piece of legislation in both Houses.\nI am told by my opponents that the use of minority members are no criterion of what the intent of the legislation is.\nI merely mention that.\nI think it was appropriate that those arguments were used on the other side of the street.\nI think it has no bearing, perhaps, as they say, on the construction of the statute that such arguments exist.\nOne other thing, again adverting to a notion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's, expressed in the questioning is the odd mixture of motivations which the Board must unravel in any one of these cases.\nNow, ordinarily, when you think of unfair labor practices in this connotation, you think of somebody being fired over an issue of discrimination, and that's the simply way.\nBut, it isn't always the simple way in which an unfair labor practice is -- an unfair labor practice occurs because one of the unfair labor practices is refusal to bargain.\nLet us say, the fact situation -- the fact situation based on England -- on Inland Steel case is assumed.\nThere, the union came in and asked for a pension.\nThe employer said, \u201cWell, we will bargain with you on all other demands but we will not bargain with you on your pension.\nWe think that is not a bargainable issue.\nWe're not required to bargain under it.\u201d",
    "5": "We'll hear argument next in No. 87-746, Michael H. and Victoria D. v. Gerald D..\nMr. Boraks, you may proceed whenever you're ready.\nThis was while the mother was married to Gerald, right?\nThey have never been divorced?\nSo any time a wife has a child by somebody other than the husband it kind of becomes a menage a trois?\nThe lover is introduced into the structural relationship of the marriage.\nWell, with one, one week, you said, would be enough.\nBut it would be, it would be a factual determination in every case.\nI mean, if you can't tell, if it's strictly a question of, you know, how does it grab you, the state can't lay down any rule.\nIt's got to have a hearing every time this happens, and the lover-father wants to get in the act.\nWell, but that's tautological.\nWell, what, what relationship does qualify for a liberty interest?\nWell, what if, what if the natural father comes over to the house and says, I want to see my natural father, the husband says, get out of here.\nNow, is the natural father entitled to pursue that relationship even though the husband does not want him to?\n--Thank you, Mr. Boraks.\nWe'll hear now from you, Mr. Hoffman.\nAnd that's true even though the mother was married at all times to someone else?\nHow many votes in the Supreme Court of California does it take to decertify an opinion of the Court of Appeals?\nWell, it can't even be published, can it?\nWell, it doesn't appear in the CA report.\nSo in effect its application depends to a certain extent on the position the mother takes.\nAnd that's where the presumption applies.\nThank you, Mr. Hoffman.\nMr. Boraks, you have four minutes remaining.\nThank you, Mr. Boraks.\nThe case is submitted.",
    "6": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe questions posed to Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Avila suggest what the State would have suggested independently, which is that the context of this proceeding is a very important focus as well as the scope of a covered jurisdiction once it's determined, by virtue of the statutory formula, that a jurisdiction must seek preclearance of voting changes.\nThe nature of this case, as Justice Souter has suggested, is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.\nIt's called a coverage case under section 5, and the only inquiry in these cases is whether there is a covered jurisdiction, if so, whether that jurisdiction is enacting or seeking to administer a new change which it has initiated affecting voting rights, and then the third question is, did they first obtain the requisite preclearance?\nSo in that sense... in our briefs we use the word technical.\nI understand that that's a confusing, perhaps a misnomer, but it is a procedural question of whether or not they've done the requisite steps to get Federal approval before implementing something that a covered jurisdiction has initiated.\nThat is the common remedy.\nIt's a declaration that--\n--Nothing more.\nCertainly on this complaint.\nWell, in Clark v. Roemer this Court very strongly suggested that that may be the case.\nIn most cases the elections must be enjoined.\nThis Court--\n--Well, for several reasons we don't believe the elections should have been enjoined here.\nUnder Clark v. Roemer this Court said that there may be extraordinary circumstances in which an injunction would not be appropriate, and it gave an example, which is one in which the action was filed at the eleventh hour, the election processes were already well-advanced, and that there were equitable reasons why the elections should be permitted to go forward.\nHere, the complaint was filed in 1991, and it was challenging 1968 through 1983 ordinances.\nIn Clark the Court made the point that there was no showing that the plaintiffs were not diligent.\nHere, I suggest that quite the opposite fact is true.\nFurthermore, as the Court has pointed out, there have been intervening State actions.\nThe State is not a covered jurisdiction, and the State has... for one thing, the people through an initiative measure have eliminated justice courts altogether.\nThe State has also enacted statutes, particularly Government Code section 73560, which state as a matter of State law what the municipal court district is in Monterey County, and--\n--Yes.\nThe State... the State is not--\n--Well, I believe that... Justice Stevens, I believe that addresses informal as opposed to formal actions by a covered jurisdiction.\nThe covered jurisdiction may initiate by promulgating a regulation if it's a county--\n--Exactly.\nThere's always the remedy, and several members of this Court have suggested this, there's always the remedy of proceeding under section 2, or the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIf it--\n--Well, with respect, Justice Souter, I don't think it defeats the purpose of section 5.\nSection--\n--That is our position.\nI agree with that, too.\nI just took from the tone of the question--\n--Well, of course there is.\nThe citizens within the covered jurisdiction are still protected against any action of that identified jurisdiction, but the fact that another governmental entity has made some change within its sovereign power that has some effect upon voting rights--\n--It's true that the Secretary of State's Office for the State of California does submit on occasion... I don't think it's absolutely every time, but it does submit regularly State statutes and enactments for preclearance, but this Court has never held, and it's been our position throughout this case, to answer your question, that the State is not a covered jurisdiction, and therefore its enactments do not require preclearance.\nIt has, Your Honor.\nThe Court is probably aware--\n--That is exactly what has happened, and also--\n--There's a Department of Justice regulation... I believe it's section 51.23 of 28 Code of Federal Regulations... which suggests that States have that requirement, and in an abundance of caution the Secretary of State's Office has, as a general matter, attempted to obtain preclearance, but this Court has never held that such preclearance is required of an uncovered jurisdiction, and I would suggest that it's a very grave incursion into principles of federalism to do so.\nThe--\n--Yes.\nIt's various consolidation ordinances--\n--No.\nState law permitted the counties to adopt--\n--No, although there's some confusion on the record in that respect.\nThe county through its counsel in its initial motion to dismiss early on in the case, before we were involved at all, indicated that it required legislative permission in advance, and the--\n--I think that's right, that the legislative--\n--No, I believe they are, Justice O'Connor, because we... the State is now, as you know, a defendant party.\nIt was made a party for the first time as part of the order that's now on appeal here, and we have argued that because the countywide elections are conducted pursuant to State law, that there's no place for a section 5 proceeding here, the reason being that when the Court in South Carolina--\n--Oh, I see, Your Honor.\nI misunderstood your question.\nAt the time the ordinances were passed, the county had the discretion--\n--to design the district--\n--But at the time the lawsuit was filed, there was on the books a State statute indicating that the Monterey County Municipal Court District is the entirety of Monterey County... that's section 73560 of the Government Code... and there was this change in the State's constitution, Article VI, section 5, which said that there may no longer be Statewide--\n--No, but the point is--\n--that at the time they filed it, 20 years after the first of these ordinances, things had changed considerably, and the State during that intervening period had dictated what the Monterey County Municipal Justice--\n--Because--\n--Our arguments go to whether preclearance is required.\nThey go first of all to whether a statute enacted by a jurisdiction that has not come within the covered formula is nevertheless subject to preclearance--\n--Right.\nThe issue is still open in the district court.\nThe district court's order that is under appeal here specifically says, now that the State has been made a defendant on this day, November 1, 1995, it shall have the opportunity to raise defenses--\n--Your Honor, that would have been fine.\nWe would dispute that an injunction should be put into effect until the court is certain that there is in fact a preclearance requirement that was not met.\nThat remains an open question.\nAs the Court said in its November order, the State may have this case dismissed on the basis that preclearance is not required.\nBut your point, Your Honor, about the status quo is very important, because had the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice been content to have an injunction preventing these countywide elections pending preclearance, that would have been fine.\nThat would have been what Clark says to do.\nThey instead urged the court, and the court ultimately did their bidding, to fashion a new order, a remedial order.\nWe cannot.\nNo.\nAs Justice O'Connor pointed out, this proceeding is simply to determine whether an enactment is subject to preclearance.\nPreclearance encompasses not just enactments that harm minority voting rights, it encompasses neutral enactments, and it encompasses enactments that greatly enhance minority rights.\nAny of those kinds of actions have to be precleared before they can be implemented, so at this point the mere fact that the court found that this consolidation had to be precleared says nothing about whether there's any substantive harm.\nAnd because there's no substantive harm yet proven or established and because, as Justice Souter pointed out, there's no constitutional or section 2 challenge filed, there's no parallel case, as there was in Allen and Clark and Morse, where the constitutionality of the practices are being challenged, there is... the court has no basis upon which to fashion any remedial order.\nYes.\nThey stipulated that they were unable to--\n--Well, I'm not sure it does, Justice Stevens, because the district court... this Court has held, in defining the different kinds of actions that may be brought under the Voting Rights Act, it has specifically said that a coverage case such as this, where the only question was coverage, has no jurisdiction to determine either retrogression, which is expressly limited to the District of Columbia courts, or constitutional violations.\nThey are all beside the point.\nAs part of these interim orders that they urged the court to order, to direct, the parties stipulated... not the State, certainly, but the parties then existing, stipulated that the county was unable to establish that the ordinances, that several of the ordinances, it wasn't specific, were not retrogressive in that they may have had--\n--Yes, of proving that several of them were not, and that was all they stipulated.\nThere was no... normally in the District of Columbia court, if there's a determination of retrogression the court gives some guidance about what it is that's a problem, and perhaps how it can be remedied.\nHere, we don't know which, if any consolidated--\n--That is irrelevant, Your Honor.\nYes.\nYes.\nAnd that's the normal remedy.\nI believe that's what this Court said in--\n--Absent extraordinary circumstances that seems to be the limits of this coverage case court's remedial authority.\nNow, here in particular, we would argue that the court did not need to enjoin then.\nFor one thing, as we say, the question of whether preclearance was required is now reopened, because the State is now a defendant, and can argue that the State is not subject to preclearance, and that these elections are conducted pursuant to State law at this late date.\nSecondly, that Clark says that there may be extraordinary circumstances which could come into play.\nAs we pointed out, there was no diligence here.\nThe process... not in the sense that it was at the eleventh hour and that primaries were going to be held the next day, but in the sense that the State has, since these ordinances, dictated how municipal court elections shall be conducted, those have come to play.\nSecondly,--\n--No.\nIt's relevant because a noncovered jurisdiction has some substantial say if not dispositive say in the elections as they're--\n--Well, it's the fact that they waited 20 years, permitted a great deal of time in which the State took several actions with respect to justice and municipal courts in Monterey County, so their diligence... had they filed this action immediately after passage of the first ordinance, or the second, or the third, and taken issue with it at the time, then an injunction would have been against the county, I suppose, at least much more clearly.\nNow, the State has developed law, including the initiative voted by the entire population of the State, to eliminate justice courts, and that is in the midst... one point to be made about how much the State is involved here is to look at the remedy which they have sought here.\nThey didn't seek an injunction that would put the status quo... that is, the 1968 system... back in effect.\nThey sought an affirmative remedial order by the court which, among other things, annulled or suspended State laws.\nIt annulled or suspended--\n--Actually, Your Honor, the State interest is not in having countywide jurisdiction.\nMr. Avila was correct that there are municipal courts that are less than county, but the underlying State interest is very much that every voting citizen within a judicial district is entitled to vote for the judges of that district, and that was thrown out the window by the interim plan.\nSimilarly, there's a State interest, constitutional in nature, that no city shall be split in a municipal court district.\nThat was thrown out the window.\nBut that's even worse, Your Honor, than dividing it into--\n--Yes, and we of course disagree to the extent that it belittled the State's interest.\nBut the point is, there are constitutional... constitutional provisions that were in existence before even Monterey County became a covered jurisdiction.\nThese are 1966, the most recent enactments of Article VI, section 5, and Article VI, section 16.\nThey're 1966.\nEven if the State were a covered jurisdiction, a coverage question would have to find that those enactments are not subject--\n--That... yes, Justice Stevens, that in combination with the fact that the interim remedy... and I always put it in quotes... was issued in the first place, because I believe that Miller--\n--Well, that's correct, on the basis that it was... substantial questions about its--\n--constitutionality came into play.\nWell, the court didn't say there was a Miller violation.\nBut I don't see how it could come to any other conclusion, Your Honor.\nBut let me say that the mix... what we've been talking about is a normal section 5 coverage case where the only question is whether a statute enactment or informal something that a covered jurisdiction seeks to administer requires preclearance and hasn't yet had it.\nBut when the court decided... it was very ill-advised, we believe beyond its jurisdiction, but it decided to redesign, reconfigure the county court system in Monterey and to suspend or annual State laws and State constitutional provisions.\nIt then had another order.\nThat changed the mix entirely, and we submit that the court then had jurisdiction to correct its own error, to eliminate this unconstitutional or substantially unconstitutional order and to put things back where they were.\nThe court was trying to return to the status quo.\nThat's why we believe it ordered that there be a one-time countywide election, because when the case first came to this court the judges on the Monterey County Municipal Court had been elected countywide.\nThe court changed that.\nIt changed it in a race-based fashion that it was inappropriate to do and the court's November order points out, we don't accept the retrogression stipulation, meaning we now recognize that that's not our domain, it's for the district court in the District of Columbia, and we're not the section 2 court, meaning all these stipulations--\n--The district court did say that Miller draws into question whether any reliance on race may be invalid, but it didn't go that far.\nYour Honor, I think the sentence that the court... that you're citing in the court's decision is certainly subject to some scrutiny and clarification, but that was not necessary to the Court's decision here.\nIn normal cases, including Miller and Shaw, the Court asks about the constitutionality of districting in a context where districting is the normal procedure, and there are normal districting principles... the decennial reapportionments, for instance.\nIn this case, the traditional districting principle as far as dividing any judicial district in California is, we don't do it.\nWe do not do it.\nYes.\nMy point is that the traditional districting principles, as that phrase is normally used in decennial reapportionments, doesn't apply here.\nThe districting principles that apply here... districts are designed for administrative convenience in the justice courts, so the notion of it, maybe... maybe in a hearing they could prove that it was contiguous, so what?\nExcept, Your Honor, that I think the court's most recent order, the November order, was an attempt to correct what it had unfortunately messed up initially.\nThe court should not have issued the December 1994 order, which injected race, divided the county, it gave 10 percent of the voters within a judicial district the right and power to elect a judge that is sitting over the whole district--\n--Well, but that would then be the status quo, as the Court has used it.\nThat would be what was left.\nThat's the trouble.\nThe court's effort was to correct that and bring things back the way they were initially.\nI think that was laudable.\nWell, the court has not expressly stated that it's remedy, its '94 remedy was unconstitutional, but as I started to point out, the only purpose for the dividing of this district was race.\nWell, and at this point it would be moot, except for the extension of terms, because the court was obviously uncomfortable with its remedy in the first place.\nNo, it would, because the court has extended the terms.\nBut the court--\n--Well, when the Court held its hearing on Miller, that was the question it wanted to address--\n--Well, that's true, Your Honor, although in the meantime the results of that unconstitutional--\n--Yes.\nBut on the same token, on these facts this Court it seems to me could very quickly and easily find that under Miller, that--\n--Well--\n--Well, actually, I did submit a map which shows that there's no--\n--Well, the principal reason that you know Miller should annul this interim remedy of December '94 is the point made by Justice O'Connor that no substantive harm to voting rights has been established, so any remedy that brings race in at all, any remedy at all is inappropriate in this Court.\nWell, that's... it would be a very different case if this were in the district court and if retrogression, a substantive violation had been determined.\nThen the Court would have options.\nWell, it's correct that it hasn't yet gotten to any court in which substantive harm can be determined.\nThank you.",
    "7": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI represent Petitioner J. Truett Payne Company.\nWe filed this secondary line Robinson-Patman Act price discrimination case, resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the petitioner.\nAfter a motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict was denied, in the 5th Circuit it was appealed and the 5th Circuit reversed on the grounds that the plaintiff, petitioner in this instance, must prove the specific lost sales or lost profits.\nAnd that is the only method of proving the fact of the injury.\nAnd a second and underlying factor in the reversal was that the petitioner failed to prove a reasonable estimate of the amount of the price discrimination or damage and that the actual amount of the discrimination was not sufficient by which the court could estimate the damage, or by which the jury could estimate the damage.\nThis Court is faced with the damage issues under the Robinson-Patman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which bring into focus the 5th Circuit's requirement of a plaintiff proving specific lost profits or lost sales as the only means of recovering under the Robinson-Patman Act, and whether or not that requirement imposes an inflated standard of proof thereby effectively denying private attorney generals the ability to enforce the Act and recover for a wrong; and secondly, whether or not the amount of the price differential is sufficient evidence to give a reasonable and proper estimate of the amount of the damage.\nThe 5th Circuit in its opinion misconstrues not only the law but I believe in misconstruing the law underlying the problem was misconstruing Payne's position.\nIt stated that Payne claimed that in a total vacuum price discrimination alone was sufficient to give rise to an injury under Section 4 of the Act, of the Clayton Act.\nAnd I submit that that is the basis upon which the court totally ignored this Court's findings and holdings in Bruce's Juices case, in 1947, and the FTC v. Morton Salt case in 1948.\nMr. Justice Rehnquist, I would say that if price discrimination alone with absolutely no other evidence is the only evidence before the Court, then I would say that that's true; that price discrimination in a vacuum cannot be found to cause injury.\nI think you have got to go farther.\nI would not mind that finding.\nBut I would submit to Your Honor, Mr. Justice White, that in this case there was substantial corroborating evidence supporting an inference of injury resulting from substantial price discrimination taking place, occurring in a market where there was keen competition and in the face of tight profit margins, and where the substantial price discrimination could have been reflected in the retail sales price.\nNow, under those circumstances the 5th Circuit didn't address that, it just said, the only way that you could prove injury is to show proof of lost sales and lost profits, but under the circumstances in this case the jury, the fact finder, whether it be a jury or a court, could have inferred injury from the existence of those factors, plus the price discrimination itself.\nSo, in answer to your question, I think that this Court need not address whether or not price discrimination standing alone in a vacuum gives rise to injury or competitive injury.\nBecause the facts of this case show a substantial supporting... substantial corroborating evidence supporting not only the proof of actual competitive injury, not just a finding of a likelihood or probability of injury, but testimony that competition itself was harmed, and support an inference that would support the jury's finding which could give rise to an inference of damage to the disfavored purchaser.\nUnder the... no other rebutting evidence whatsoever, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do.\nBecause that would then be a case where you would have price discrimination, not in a vacuum, but disregarding Mr. Payne's testimony, which the 5th Circuit discounts by saying that this is a conclusion of one of the injured parties, I still say that it is corroborating evidence which put together with the vast amount of other corroborating evidence would permit at least, at the very least, the jury to determine the fact of whether or not there was damage.\nAnd the 5th Circuit says, it doesn't address these other--\n--I believe, under even the standards that this Court has established on proof of damage and proof of amount of damage, that you would have to go farther than just mere self serving conclusions in the absence of any other supporting evidence.\nHowever, if... like in this case... the amounts of the price discriminations which resulted... Chrysler, in a rebate program... let me just go into the background just a moment, if it please the court.\nRebate programs were formulated by Chrysler whereby the amount of money that was paid to the competing dealers in the Birmingham market was determined by a quota that was reached, or not reached, by the competing dealers.\nThe quotas were different for each dealer, and the price rebate would thereby lower the price and cause the discrimination, if everybody were not rebated the same price on the same model automobile.\nAnd in this case there was evidence of substantial amounts of discrimination occurring, sometimes several hundred dollars per automobile, in a period... we're talking about 50 or more automobiles a month, and these rebate programs lasted two and three months in duration.\nSo, when you put that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, together with Mr. Payne's testimony, the actual fact of the price discrimination, the duration of the substantial nature of it, and the amounts of it, then I say that that would be an issue that should be submitted to the trier of fact, as to whether or not the trier of fact could infer damage without proof of specific lost sales or lost profits.\nThe testimony in this case showed that during a 3-1/2-year period from approximately December, 1970... November, 1973... May, 1974, when Payne went out of business, that the price discrimination totalled about $81,000.\nThere were 16 rebate programs which caused the price discrimination, and of those 16 programs 13 caused damage to Payne, and that damaged... that Payne was not favored, he was a disfavored dealer in those 13.\nOf those other three programs, one of the programs was a program that had a quota established by Chrysler by which the dealer had to reach that quota in order to get paid and Payne reached that one quota and did not get injured in that program.\nThe other two programs where there was no discrimination were an across the board percentage rebate to everybody on a per car basis, so there was no discrimination at all.\nSo, out of those 16 programs over a 3-1/2-year period, Payne was injured, was a disfavored dealer in 13 of them.\nThere was testimony not only by Payne that his company lost business in the form of lost sales, but also that his company in order to maintain sales had to overallow on the used car trade in and that was a factor in the testimony of Dr. Ignatin and in the testimony, as a matter of fact, of Chrysler's witnesses which analyzed the used car business of Payne, saying that, one, that the main problem with Payne was its used car business was losing money.\nSo you've got the fact that Payne testified that he was overallowing in order to get business coupled with the corroborating testimony that there was a real problem in the used car business, coupled with a factor of substantial, sustained price discriminations over 3-1/2 years.\nThere was testimony of an actual decline in the market, percentage of the market that Payne had from 1971 and 1972.\nThere was also testimony that the price discrimination adversely affected competition and injured competition because it had a two pronged effect.\nThe first thing was that it did not permit Payne to compete on an even and equal basis.\nHe was at a trade disadvantage because his cars cost more than the other competing dealers.\nSecondly, the price of a new car is determined by the discounting off of the list price, and everybody knows that, and the economist that analyzed the industry in Birmingham determined that because the competing dealers, the favored dealers, did not have to discount off list price quite as much as they otherwise would have since they were favored and Payne was not favored with the rebate, with the price discrimination, and because Payne could not discount off list price as much as he otherwise would have done because of the lack of the price rebate, that that raised the price, the ultimate retail price to the consumer in the market to a slight degree.\nAnd the 5th Circuit in its opinion did not consider all of this evidence as giving rise at least to the submission to a jury as to whether or not injury in fact under the antitrust laws could be caused.\nThe 5th Circuit said that the only way you can prove injury is to prove lost profits or lost sales.\nThis Court considered the same issue in a different context in Bruce's Juices v. American Can Company, and in that case, although the ultimate finding was much narrower, the Court was faced with an analysis exactly the same as in this case, because the plaintiff in that case had said that the price discrimination statute ought to void the contract involved in the transaction where there was price discrimination.\nThe court said, and the plaintiff also said, that the treble damage remedy under the Robinson-Patman Act was ineffective.\nThis Court said, no, because all that there would be normal, or all that would be necessary in the absence of extraordinary circumstances would be to prove the substantial price differential, and that would be damage, and the amount of that damage would be that differential.\nIn that finding, and it's more than mere dictum... I know that Chrysler characterized it as dictum... but this court had to analyze how you would prove price discrimination how you would prove damage under the Act that would be an effective remedy.\nAnd it recognized that, it recognized what Chrysler ignores, and what the 5th Circuit ignores, and that is that the defendant in a price discrimination case would always have the chance of rebutting the inference of injury.\nIt's not an automatic injury rule, despite their characterization of it; it gives rise to an inference of injury.\nThe factfinder should be allowed to determine whether in fact there was injury or not.\nAnd if substantial evidence is introduced by the defendant showing that these \"extraordinary circumstances\" exist in the marketplace, then price discrimination, whether it be substantial or sustained, is not going to give rise to the damage.\nBut it is a jury issue.\nOnly in the context, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of the competition in the market, because that in effect reduced the price.\nThere was testimony by both the expert witnesses that that reduced the price of automobiles and that the automobiles, originally, each model was priced the same.\nTherefore, the product that was being sold in the market was costed, cost more to Payne than it did to the other dealers who were competing in that very same time frame under that very same program for the sale to the very same customers in that market, and that put Payne at a total disadvantage in sales.\nNow, there are several things that can happen when that occurs.\nThe disfavored purchaser could keep his same price and eat the higher cost, and reduce the profit.\nOr he could have passed the price increase, the higher cost, along to the customer, in which there's an expectation of lost sales.\nBut this Court has said in Hanover Shoe case and in the Illinois Brisk case that it is insurmountable almost to predict the effect of the higher cost of a product upon, or measure the effect a higher cost will have on the sales of a company.\nAnd therefore, to require proof of an actual loss in sales volume traceable directly to the price discrimination as the only means of proving the fact of damage, flies in the face of what this Court has said is the policy behind enforcing the antitrust laws.\nTo a certain extent it's true that Chrysler's rebates lessened the price, the ultimate price of the car to my client.\nBut it didn't, it put our client at a disadvantage, because our client had a higher cost on those very same cars than the favored dealers.\nI think that what you may be getting at is whether or not the fact that there was a benefit to my client, does that countervail away against the fact that there was a larger benefit to his competitor?\nAnd I submit that the answer is an unqualified no; it doesn't matter that Payne received a benefit, because ultimately the other people, the competing dealers, received a less priced automobile and were able to take away either sales either profits, or either use more customer attracting services and get the business and let Payne not withstand the difficult times in the market that eventually caused its demise.\nYes, Mr. Justice White, it is.\nIt's an injury to competition; yes, it is.\nThe Court of Appeals, if I read their opinion correctly, stated that the proof of price discrimination by itself does not prove competitive injury, nor does it prove--\n--That's correct.\nIt did not--\n--That's... right.\nThey never addressed whether or not under the elements of Section 2(a) of the Act were met.\nBut it simply went off on the fact that no injury, according to it, was proved, because no lost profits and no lost sales were shown.\nAbsolutely.\nI think that the 5th Circuit recognized that.\nWell, they distinguished paying more for cars and lost profits.\nThey distinguished that by saying under the enterprise doctrine that just means that my client was not as well off as the more favored dealers.\nIt did not... this is their rationale, this is the 5th Circuit rationale... that it didn't damage Payne because he had to pay a higher price, it merely made the other competitors in a better position.\nWell, that's turning the whole theory of price discrimination on its head, as it were, because the evil that price discrimination is designed to remedy is the difference, the lower cost, to the favored dealer.\nIt doesn't matter whether you say it's an overcharge or an undercharge, it's still an injury in the form of eventually--\n--Yes, you can, Mr. Justice White.\nThat ignores the economic reality of the marketplace in that had the disfavored dealer received a lower cost, it might have and could have theoretically in a competitive market reduced its sales price, retail sales price, maximized its volume, keeping the same profit margin, and thereby, since it had more volume and more profit... more volume times the same profit margin, it lost profits.\nAnd that is the whole theory of our economic system.\nWell, the favored dealer may not have wanted to pick up sales.\nIt could have kept its same price.\nI believe that's what your hypothetical envisioned.\nAnd therefore it could have done a lot of things.\nIt could have cut back on its advertising, it could have pocketed the additional profit, it could have done a lot of things.\nBut the end result is that because the favored dealer has a lower cost the economic opportunities, the position in the market of the disfavored purchaser is injured.\nThat's what this Court said in Morton Salt.\nAnd it used the words,\n\"There is an obvious inference of damage. \"\nto a merchant that pays a higher price for the same product than its competing merchants and the competing seller.\nYes, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe I mentioned just briefly that the economist testified that the price discrimination resulted in a two pronged effect.\nNumber one, it made my client less able to compete, less able to have as much profit.\nSecondly, it raised slightly the retail sales price to the ultimate consumer in the market.\nTherefore you have two types of injuries to competition.\nCertainly competition is supposed to envision the most efficient use of resources to get the lowest price to the ultimate consumer.\nAs, in his view, that was the effect of that type of rebate program.\nThat's another piece of corroborating evidence that supports--\n--That's true, but the Court of Appeals again took the position, Mr. Justice Stevens, that despite the expert testimony by Dr. Ignatin that the price discrimination... if there had not been any price discrimination, Payne would not have gone out of business.\nThey said that's just not supportable.\nWhy?\nI don't know.\nIt may have been that in a footnote to the opinion in the 5th Circuit they said that Dr. Ignatin prefaced his testimony about that by saying that it was speculation.\nWell, that is an inaccurate statement and I mentioned that in my brief on the merits, and the 5th Circuit just made an error, because I cited to the record where he answered a question, that it's speculative.\nHe answered in that fashion, to a question from counsel for Chrysler that, is there any way to formulate a rebate program that does not discriminate?\nHe said, well, it's speculative, but I can tell you this, had there not been any discrimination, absent that, Payne would not have gone out of business.\nAnd that was the testimony, and how that can be discounted when an expert economist... that's the only way we can try to prove injury is to get someone other than conclusory statements which the 5th Circuit has said is not permissible.\nI think that's a good inference, if you will, from the reading of the 5th Circuit's opinion but I would like to say also that the statutory requirements under Section 2(a) are even less than showing injury to competition.\nAll you need to show is a probability of injury to competition.\nTo show a violation--\n--Not the competition, Mr. Justice White.\nI think he could prove injury to the business, the disfavored purchaser, because he is... competition.\nI don't think so.\nI don't think, in your way of saying it, because proof of injury to the business is proof of injury to competition.\nI don't think so, Mr. Justice Powell.\nWe contend that injury to a business is in fact injury to competition.\nIf you have less competitors, if one is put out of the market, if one is less able to compete, or for whatever reason, then that in itself weakens competition and is injury to competition as well under Section 2(a) of the Act, as well as the injury under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.\nIf you prove discrimination that is sufficient to show or allow a jury to reach the inference of injury, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.\nNot just... for instance this is not a per se, this is not an automatic, it's got to be sufficient discrimination to permit the reasonable inference.\nThat's exactly what this Court was holding in Morton Salt.\nI am.\nI'm saying it both ways.\nThere is adequate evidence, statistical evidence of tight profits, testimony of lost sales, testimony that people came into the shop and were shopping competition saying that they couldn't buy at Payne because it was high, or wouldn't buy at Payne.\nI do, and the 8th Circuit's, and the 7th Circuit's, in Bargain Car Wash, Mr. Justice White, as not permitting... or not saying automatic damage, because it is, there's always the possibility of rebuttal by the defendant if the extraordinary circumstances this Court talked about in Bruce's Juices are present.\nFor instance, if there is such an inelastic market that it really doesn't matter--\n--That is the presumption... the presumptive damage rule was in the Senate's version of the bill.\nIt was eliminated in conference due to legislative bargaining without comment.\nAnd I say to Your Honors that if you utilize that negative inference just because it was originally in there, without finding out the real reason behind why it was eliminated, then you totally disregard the purpose of the Act.\nI say that this Court should reaffirm the minimum damage rule that it indicated in Bruce's Juices and in Morton Salt which permits an inference of damage, at least in that amount, subject to rebuttal, and that the mere fact that there was at one point a provision of presumptive damages does not mean that that, the elimination of it by Congress meant that Congress didn't want that type rule, because that rule was redundant.\nIt was always extant under the Clayton Act, Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as is pointed out in our original brief and reply brief; I think the Ladoga decision permitted it.\nThank you.",
    "8": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case concerns the appealability of remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, or SLUSA.\nOur position is that the general rule prohibiting appealability applies in this case for three reasons.\nFirst, section 1447(d) has been consistently construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on a district court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nThat rule governs even if the district court incorrectly construes a subject matter jurisdiction provision.\nSecond, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by incorporating the criteria for preemption.\nThus, the court's subject matter jurisdiction is coextensive with those cases that SLUSA preempts.\nAnd third, Congress knows how to make remand orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains no provision for appellate review of remand orders.\nUnder respondent's approach, the Federal courts would obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA preemption, but there's no indication that Congress intended that result.\nNo, it's not.\nBecause under this Court's longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion, there must be a right of appellate review.\nSo if you agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the basis on which that order is... is founded, the preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to address on remand.\nThat's correct, through the State court system.\nHe was wrong.\nThe issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by the defendants on remand in the State courts.\nIt can be litigated.\nIt's important to note that the removal provision says, shall be removable.\nIt's at the defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case or to keep it in State court for the State court to apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action would be unsustainable.\nThere are cases in the lower courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of complete preemption was not sustainable because the case was not completely preempted, but holding that preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied by the State courts on remand.\nAnd it's important to note here that there--\n--Not that I'm aware of, but what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal of that particular order was because it would be held preclusive.\nHere, it would not be held preclusive because there is no right of appellate review.\nThat is certainly true, although I would take issue with the notion of there being a colorable claim.\nI don't think that the SLUSA removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal statute where the statute itself says the defense has to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v. California case said that phrase is where the colorable claim creates Article III jurisdiction.\nBut I... I don't... sorry.\nIf I could just finish.\nI don't contest the rest of it, which is that on remand, preemption can be developed through amended pleadings, through facts that are developed--\n--Well, under their theory, though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of their construction of the removal jurisdiction provision, would retain jurisdiction.\nWell, and we think that that position that they have advanced in this Court is incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that what the Federal district court does and it has jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does apply, to dismiss it.\nIt does... it does do that.\nIt's--\n--I thought I expressed my--\n--That's... on the basis of the record then before it.\nYes.\nThe court always has the authority to have evidence taken to determine its own jurisdiction.\nThat's routinely done by district courts.\nI... I agree with you that that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion and what... what the adjudicatory authority was, and that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit.\nWe do think that the State court on remand has any issue that the defendants want to raise before it.\nAll that the Federal district court has done is to decide that... that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption because the requisites of subsection (b) had been satisfied.\nBut I want to point out that the issue before you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is appealable.\nAnd what is important in the error of the Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a district court decision that is erroneous in its construction of a subject matter jurisdiction provision is still a remand based on subject matter jurisdiction and therefore falls within the four corners--\n--And our problem with that, Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court decisions here thought that they were deciding subject matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for removal.\nAnd--\n--It... it is--\n--Well, functionally it is the equivalent of codifying the complete preemption doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works.\nAnd in the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what spells out this--\n--It would be a strikingly odd result, though, for this Court to reach that, given that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review of remand orders in other contexts, including in the Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases.\nSo Congress knows how to do this if that's what Congress had intended.\nWell, I think that the closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption area where the Court has held that, you know, the removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is found by the district court, that functionally terminates the litigation.\nBut I would point out that even in the Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate review of a district court's decision that the Federal officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an action.\nSo what the securities defendants here are asking for is something Congress didn't even give to Federal officers.\nIt had the... it had the power to determine whether SLUSA applied.\nAnd that's what section 77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b), is referring to.\nSo the district court analyzed those factors and it came--\n--Yes.\nBecause the courts held that the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been satisfied.\nThat's correct.\nIt is possible, but that's why the issue of the underlying district court's determination is not before you.\nThe issue before you is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review that decision.\nBut I would further point out, Justice Stevens, that the Davit court assiduously avoided the kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is whether or not negligence can be asserted against the securities defendants for failure to fair value price.\nDabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made clear.\nThis is a negligence case, and there is a part of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what SLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud.\nBut even if you were to disagree that the... the district court had, you know, an alternate basis that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by the district court because it went off on the holder theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have stated, that the Court doesn't have jurisdiction to review... appellate review of a remand order.\nThat's incorrect, Justice Ginsburg.\nWe've put the complaints before you.\nThey are in the joint appendix.\nWe have cited every paragraph in which those claims are asserted.\nThe Seventh Circuit based its decision about that on a misunderstanding of the colloquy at oral argument in the Seventh Circuit, which respondents have recited the Web site.\nYou can listen to the argument yourself.\nIt did not contain any type of concession by counsel for the class that these claims were anything other than the negligence claims, which on the four corners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be.\nThe briefs recounted what the claims are, which are negligence claims.\nWell, the Seventh Circuit made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe the district court as saying that removal was proper.\nThe district court didn't say that.\nThey were wrong to say that the remand was based on section 77(d)(4).\nThat's not what the district court did.\nThey were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c) without even reciting or construing the language.\nThey were wrong to say that SLUSA's substantive decisions, quote, must be made by the Federal rather than the State judiciary.\nThat's not correct.\nAnd they were wrong to say that it was now or never for appellate review whether an action under State law is preempted.\nBut the point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\nIt's not waivable and we're permitted to say that a district court decision based on subject matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims.\nIt is true that the perception at the time was that these holder theories evaded SLUSA.\nAll of the courts up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to take.\nNow, certainly after Dabit, those claims are foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims.\nWe do... we obviously don't take issue with that.\nBut here, the claims in the complaint themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly fair--\n--Well, this Court in the Santa Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims are not within 10b-5.\nThose are claims that are properly brought under State law.\nSo if the... if the State court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under the Santa Fe case.\nIt does come up often because the securities bar, every time they get a district court decision that they don't like, they want to appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of appealability.\nSo this issue is something that is very important to both sides in the development of this law.\nBut I would further point out, Justice Breyer, that as this case has come up, your... your view would have to be based on do you have appellate jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't, subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of Dabit.\nWell, in the Cohill case, this Court addressed the situation where there was a Federal dismissal of the claims and the... and the Federal district court remanded the State claims for consideration under... under State jurisdiction.\nAnd the Court had internal discussion about whether or not, you know, there was appealability of what was left in the case.\nOur... our position is that ordinarily a dismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand decision, which is what the district court made in this case, is not.\nNo, it shouldn't and the reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided that it shouldn't.\nCongress has decided that there is a paramount interest in having decisions made on their merits, which is why there is not appellate review of remand orders.\nThat's--\n--No, Justice Alito, to the contrary.\nThey are being decided by Federal district courts.\nThey're just no subject to appellate review, and it was because--\n--No.\nWell, the... the merits of the case are going to be decided by the State court.\nThe question of whether there's a Federal defense based on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the district court in remanding the case, and then if there becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are certainly free to do that.\nNo, it is deciding.\nIt is decided by the Federal court within the confines of what Congress has determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of nonappealability unless it says so.\nI'm saying that it is final for purposes of remand.\nAnd that in terms--\n--Because... because what SLUSA does is it has an interplay between the removal jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in subsection (b).\nThat is a policy choice that Congress made when not providing a special mechanism for appellate review of remand orders.\nThat's correct, and that's where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the reviews by plaintiffs who's had their... who have had their cases dismissed.\nThose are subject to appeal.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nThank you.\nI think it's really important for you to look at the complaints in these cases because every single one of them asserts claims on the basis of negligence and the value... the fair value pricing of the securities.\nThey are not based on misrepresentations.\nThe other side has attempted to make them look like misrepresentations, and they've quoted things out of context in order to do so.\nBut the complaints themselves are pure negligence claims that would fall outside of SLUSA.\nBut even if you were to disagree with that and even if you were to disagree with the district court's basis for saying that remand was proper because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the general rule of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the Gravitt case applies.\nAnd this Court does not have appellate jurisdiction.\nThe Seventh Circuit does not have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain language of section 1447(d).\nRespondents concede that State courts can decide SLUSA questions.\nIt is up to defendants to decide whether to try to remove them.\nAnd subsection (d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides that certain kinds of securities actions shall be remanded because Congress was not so concerned that Federal courts decide everything concerning securities cases, but only as to those that are expressly set forth in subsection (b).\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what subsection (c) is doing with its references to subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one of the three elements or criteria for removability.\nIt has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection (b).\nThat's the only reasonable way to read that.\nAnd the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those are... are met, then the district court has to find that the case shall be precluded.\nIn the Gravitt case, in which this Court through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a dispute between the district court and the court of appeals over whether the district court had properly applied subject matter jurisdiction principles in deciding whether or not there was diversity.\nThis Court said, no matter.\nThat is outside the... the requisite... that is outside 1447(d), and the general rule against appealability applies.\nNow, importantly, they argue that they would be precluded by... from arguing against SLUSA preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief... the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites the Standefer case in which this Court held, under contemporary principles... and I'm quoting now... under contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.\nYes, there would be.\nAnd there would be... their argument about the Missouri Pacific case is wrong because what the... what was going on there was the remand determination, not the underlying Federal right.\nAnd that's what would be appealed, and there would also be appeal of the preclusive consequences because that would be a question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding determination.\nThe Restatement--\n--That would be covered.\nAnd... and the reason is that it is... involved a manipulation.\nThe wording of SLUSA involves a manipulation of... of the security.\nWhat... what we're talking about here, Justice Stevens... it's important... is that in how these securities get priced, was there negligence in the pricing of those, that had deleterious effects on one class of holders but not on market timers that we were moving in and out of the market.\nAnd so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong for a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there would have been a derivative claim here too because a derivative case has to be brought on behalf of the corporation on behalf of all shareholders--\n--The district court was wrong in not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but it was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no subject matter jurisdiction because this case is based on negligence and not fraud. Thank you.",
    "9": "Arey, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.\nMy name is Vernon Arey and I represent the petitioners in the instant case, Warden Garrell S. Mullaney of the Maine State Prison in the State of Maine.\nFacts of this case briefly as follows; the trial although the state's case against the respondent in this case whom I shall refer to --throughout my discussion as the defendant, since he appeared in that posture below and I referred to him as such in my brief.\nThe State of Maine alleged that Mr. Wilbur had alleged -- had inflicted such severe injuries upon the victim, Mr. Claude Hebert with his fists and a blunt instrument that Mr. Hebert died shortly after receiving this beating.\nThe theory of the defense was that though this beating had been inflicted, the actions had been generated by the heat of passion on sudden provocation because of an indecent homosexual overture made by Mr. Hebert.\nThe jury rejected this contention and convicted the defendant of murder.\nWell, Your Honor I think that depends upon tactics of counsel.\nCounsel -- excuse me, whether wisely or unwisely apparently made the decision that he did not have to place the defendant on the stand and chose to do it through failure to object to the entrance into evidence of the statements of the defendant as to what happened of that time, and then relied upon his opening argument to point out to the jury how he had felt he admit his burden as it was imposed by the State of Maine.\nAfter a complex procedural history, which need not concern us here, the defendant in 1971 appealed this case to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.\nEssentially, he argued at that time and in substance that the presiding justice at his trial had committed error when it charged that once the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt, an intentional and an unlawful killing that malice aforethought would be presumed and that the burden would be on the defendant to mitigate the crime thus proved to manslaughter of the voluntary type.\nUnless he, the defendant, established by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime was committed upon heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.\nThis has generated essentially one issue in this case.\nAnd that issue is whether in placing the burden upon the defendant to show even by a preponderance of the evidence, the absence of malice aforethought, the court has denied the defendant on this case due process of law under the rational of In re Winship.\nMaine court rejected any possible Winship violation on two essential grounds.\nFirst, it recognized that the Maine law establishes as part of its fundamental system a single generic concept of felonious homicide and that once a felonious homicide is proved, criminality is established.\nBut more than that in this case and when I get to the lower felonious homicide, I will again be emphasizing this.\nThe Maine law requires not only the mirror establishment of a felonious homicide with constituent elements to erect a presumption of malice, but a felonious homicide of a particular type and that is a felonious homicide which is either intentional or which is characterized by acts, which when objectively evaluated have a very high depth producing potential.\nIf those approved, the State of Maine establishes as its policy the crime as murder definitionally proved.\nThe process by which we define this is called a presumption of malice.\nThe Maine court in Wilbur traced the history of the single generic concept to felonious homicide as it existed in Maine for a hundred years and said, \u201cIn viewing Winship, we find that the case of In re Winship is confined to its facts.\u201d\nWhich essentially is talking about elements of criminality, when we are making the decision on the first instant, whether it be to brand and a juvenile or the label of delinquent, or a man with the label of criminal that different factors are involved in making a determination as to what due process means given that context.\nIn Maine, we are not doing this in the first instance. We are making a determination as to what the appropriate penalty shall be for a felonious homicide.\nThat is correct Your Honor.\nAnd as far as I know the statutes of Maine have never spoken of felonious homicide.\nBut tracing through the history of this case, I think it would become clear that this is deemed of no significance by the court and has been acquiesced in by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision.\nThe second ground that the Maine law court denied the defendant's appeal on was essentially that the case of Winship even if extended in the view of the Maine court would not be retroactive.\nAnd of course it's conceded by all, but that is not the case.\nThe case of In re Winship has been made retroactive by Ivan v. City of New York.\nThe defendant in this case then petitioned the District Court for its southern division with district of Maine petition writ of habeas corpus, alleging the same material that he has alleged here and we are arguing about before this Court that he argued before the Maine law court.\nPetition was granted with the reference to that one issue, but the opinion and order of the Honorable Justice Gignoux being that there was no such thing in the State of Maine as the crime of felonious homicide.\nThat the Maine statutes would not speak of the crime of felonious homicide and that the State of Maine is in effect misapplying its own law.\nThe state timely appealed from that decision of the District Court and went to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.\nPending the state's appeal to the First Circuit court in Boston, the state -- a case State v. Rollins, which is found at 295 A. 2d 914 and is cited in the brief, and is an important in establishing what the concept of felonious homicide is in Maine, was decided by the lower court.\nIt fully reaffirms the principles which were announced by Justice Weber and the original decision in Mr. Wilbur's appeal to that court.\nThe case was briefed and argued before the First Circuit, and the decision of the District Court was affirmed.\nThe State of Maine then petitioned this Honorable Court for a writ of certiorari.\nDuring the pendency of the writ of certiorari, the case of State v. Lafferty was decided by the Maine law court.\nIn State v. Lafferty is found at 309 A. 2d 647, and the case of State v. Lafferty expressly rejected the right of either the First Circuit Court of Appeals or of the Federal District Court to indicate and dictate to the State of Maine what its law was and that the State of Maine was proper in deciding its law and went on further to reaffirm the principle of the concept of felonious homicide as announced in the original Wilbur decision.\nThis Court granted petition for writ of certiorari summarily vacated the First Circuit decision, remanded the case to the First Circuit in Boston for consideration in light of the case of State v. Lafferty.\nUpon reconsideration, we finally were postured with the court -- the position of the case as it is before this Honorable Court today, because on remand, the First Circuit acceded to the fact that the law of Maine recognized the concept of a single generic offense within which the penalty category designations of murder and manslaughter operated not as elements of criminality, but as elements or factors bearing upon the punishment of an individual who has had the determination made beyond a reasonable doubt that he is a criminal.\nHowever, the court went on despite this fact, the case of In re Winship as it is announced as a matter of policy should apply to this situation because of the potential stigma which an individual faces when he is faced in the difference between life imprisonment and 20 years for manslaughter or the possibility of probation and the possibility of a man's loss of liberty is as great in a situation where you are determining punishment as it is when you are making the decision in the first instance of criminality.\nThe state respectfully suggests that that is an unwarranted extension of the case of In re Winship beyond the facts and limitations to which it spoke.\nThe state further suggests that in the there are cases in this Court which have indicated and which were relied upon by the State of Maine in the original Wilbur decision that factors bearing upon punishment have been treated differently, and we ask ourselves why.\nAnd as we go through the concept of felonious homicide, I hope that I can explain that to the Court.\nIt is critical that this Court understand what the State of Maine is talking about when it talks about the concept of a single generic offense as it is designated in the common law of the State of Maine.\nEssentially, the concept is there is one generic offense, an unlawful or a felonious homicide.\nAnd that this unlawful or felonious homicide consists of degrees and that these degrees consist of murder and manslaughter.\nManslaughter being again divided into two degrees, common law manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter, and these degrees are nothing more nor less than punishment categories which society has designated in advance for actions which have certain results attributed to them.\nNow what are the elements of felonious homicide?\nThe elements --\nThe single generic concept Your Honor, yes I believe arguably in the situation of assault.\nThat assault is recognized as the underlying crime and the element of high in aggravation is recognized as only going to punishment.\nHigh in aggravation is not recognized as being a criminal element.\nNow, the State of Maine does require that the element of high in aggravation be decided by a jury and it also requires that it be decided beyond reasonable doubt.\nI am not sure that that decision would come about the same way nor am I sure that the Ferris case, and that's the case I'm referring to, is analogous to this one, and why do I say that.\nI say that because there is no middle ground in assault by which we're going to put any burden upon the defendant to disprove or prove anything.\nThere is either simple assault which is the criminal act in itself or the element of high in aggravation.\nThere is no middle ground by which it can drop back into.\nIn other words, if in the State of Maine there were only manslaughter and murder, you would have an analogous situation, there'll be no reason for a presumption because there's nothing to mitigate to.\nYou're talking about either criminality or non-criminality the minute you drop back to the lower designation.\nSecondly, I would argue that on the facts of the case as we posture it in felonious homicide punishable as murder, the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\nBecause unlike the original common law presumption which required only the showing of an unlawful killing, and which required the defendant to establish factors in excuse and justification as well as in palliation, the main presumption does not arise until the state has proven an intentional and an unlawful killing.\nAnd the definition of unlawful is a killing which is not justified nor excused, the state bearing the burden upon the factors of criminality, the defendant bearing the burden only upon the elements of palliation.\nNow, the elements of felonious homicide in the first instance are that the victim is dead and unless be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\nSecond that the defendant killed the victim.\nThird, that the killing was voluntary that is that it was an act of his will.\nAnd lastly, that the killing is unlawful and that is that it's not justified nor excused.\nFelonious homicide punishable as murder has precisely the same four elements with one additional, and that is that the killing and addition to all these other things be intentional.\nIf that is the case, the law of Maine says that constitutes murder in that law by definition.\nThe process by which we do this is a presumption, a so called presumption of malice.\nMalice --Mr. Justice Rehnquist\nTo the extent that it says that I would have to say yes.\nThere is no question Your Honor, but what this is not the best charge for which to deal.\nI would point out however that when we talk about crimes even when we are known to be talking about degrees, we sometimes use the word crime.\nFor example, we speak about the crime of first degree murder and yet we know that first degree murder is nothing more than a degree of a crime to a murder.\nI would suggest that the language of the court if read in context, the context within which the charge is given fairly supports the rational of the Maine law court as announced in Wilbur, Rollins, and Lafferty.\nI would suggest that you do not start in the middle of the charge where the judge is talking about palliation and assuming that the state has proven an intentional and unlawful killing, but that you start at the beginning of the charge and read it from beginning to end given all of the assumptions, excuse me, that must come from what is fairly read in the charge.\nI further would cite that -- that not only did the Maine law court say precisely that this is what they had done and as according to the language of Justice Weber in the original Wilbur appeal, the court at instruction was predicated by the court.\nAnd this is the instruction about the use of the language to which Your Honor is referring, language which is inconsistent perhaps with the position of the Maine law court.\nThe court at instruction was predicated by the court upon the assumption that the jury had first been satisfied, and Your Honors will find this language on page 85 of the printed appendix, I'm sorry I didn't direct your attention to that, that the jury had first been satisfied that the state had proven a voluntary and an intentional killing beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThat is the assumption that has been throughout this case at the time that the judge is talking about mitigation.\nIt's not on the assumption of the Maine law court.\nIt's the assumption of the Federal District Court in its opinion, first opinion.\nAnd it's the decision of the First Circuit after the remand of State v. Lafferty that the jury had first been instructed that there was an intentional and an unlawful killing proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the presumption arose.\nNow malice aforethought as Maine views it, and as I have indicated as nothing more than a term of act, having no independent meaning of viability apart from the context out of which it arose, and that is that felonious homicide which are intentional shall have attributed to them the highest degree of blame within this for punishment purposes, wherein again we call this policy the so called presumption of malice.\nNow what is voluntary manslaughter within the concept of felonious homicide?\nThe punishment category of voluntary manslaughter has precisely the same elements that murder does an intentional and an unlawful killing.\nBut the unlawful killing must have been generated by heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.\nIt constitutes nothing more than a mitigating factor to the charge of felonious homicide punishable as murder.\nTo explain this further, in a charge for manslaughter, the state would not necessarily bear the burden on the fact -- on the issue of heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.\nThat's correct.\nAnd the reason it can not be Your Honor is because --\nYou can not find a murder.\nThat is the --\nThe aspect of the maliciousness, yes.\nTo that extent, what we are talking about is merely a matter of mitigation.\nWe're saying, as a matter of policy, we're gong to say that this particular crime will be punished.\nHow will it be punished?\nIt would be punished by whatever the penalty is for murder.\nBut if you can convince us that in spite of the fact that it is intentional and in spite of the fact that it's unlawful, it should be punished as manslaughter by establishing this element will do it.\nThat's correct.\nThat's precisely the way it works.\nBut because --\nAnd the reason we say that is --\nI would say no to that -- I'd say yes, even we balanced evidence creates a reasonable doubt, but when you're talking within the concept of a punishment category, instead of the concept is to whether or not the verdict is going to be guilty or not guilty.\nAnd you do that quite apart from the fact as which bearing heat of passion --\nThat's correct.\nWould've known.\nOkay, he would not have punished it as murder.\nSo there is -- yes, there is burden --\nManslaughter?\nIt's guilty of manslaughter.\nNo, it is just guilty of manslaughter.\nAnd the verdict of guilty of murder is --\nPardon?\nNo you could not.\nAs far as double jeopardy provisions are concerned, yes.\nDepends upon what the evidence in the case shows.\nIf the -- if in fact the issue of voluntary manslaughter is in the case, the verdict form would be guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter, not guilty.\nThat's correct.\nMurder, manslaughter, not guilty.\nNow it must be remembered that again it's a given that we're talking about an intentional and an unlawful killing, and therefore the only branch of felonious homicide punishable as manslaughter which was given to the jury was voluntary manslaughter that does exist a felonious homicide which is involuntary manslaughter, and that is essentially speaking in terms of what it takes to arrive the criminality bears the same elements as we have in discussing what a felonious homicide is in the first instance.\nIf the state proves a mere unlawful homicide and does not carry the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to intent, then the verdict could very properly be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nAn unlawful killing nothing more.\nNo, it is not Your Honor.\nNo it is not.\nThat is not to say that the jury could not be.\nIt is simply just to say it is not.\nAnd I think the reason for it is because it's easier to talk to a jury and have them comprehend in traditional terms.\nSuch as you and I talk about the crime perhaps of first-degree murder knowing full well that murder divided into first and second degree is really one crime, murder.\nNow, we maintain that it did not.\nWe maintain it put the burden of proof upon him to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.\nWe say that because the presence or absence of heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation is irrelevant to an establishment of murder, either as a punishment category, and as a punishment category and it's also irrelevant to the establishment of a crime.\nWhether heat of passion is present or absent in the case has no bearing whatsoever on whether the crime is lawful or unlawful on the first instance and whether it will be punished as murder or manslaughter in the first instance when the jury is viewing the evidence that has been presented by the state's case.\nThat's correct.\nThat's correct Your Honor.\nMuch the same as they have to sought out the defenses of insanity --\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\nWe say no, and we say no first of all because the case of In re Winship has been defined, as we see it, as bearing up on punishment elements.\nAnd second, even if the same harms could be said to accrue at the time that the jury is considering the question as to whether or not to mitigate the homicide, we are no longer dealing with a man who is innocent in the eyes of the law and who was no longer shielded and protected by the presumption of innocence, because we have a man whom the jury had to find by definition committed an intentional and an unlawful killing upon another human being in a state which has defined those actions as constituting murder.\nPrecisely, that the same analysis could apply.\nAnd that we're dealing with a matter of definition of the state's internal law as to what does or what does not constitute a crime, and the facts of this case and as it is viewed by the Maine law court does not come up -- the due process is not violated.\nWe're not saying that fairness doesn't apply.\nWe're not saying that some of the same high may not float, but we're saying you view due process differently when you're dealing with a man who is guilty and who has been found to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, than you do a man with whom you are taking in and trying to make a determination on the first instance as to --\nYes, Your Honor and --\nWell we --\nThat was discussed in Leland --\nThat was discussed in Leland versus Oregon Your Honor, and I think the assumption has to be that juries follow the instructions that we give them, that juries have been given conflicting burdens in criminal cases for years and have managed to --\nWell that the determination of what proof was beyond reasonable doubt is defined.\nThe burden that deals with the preponderance of the evidence is defined.\nAnd when we tell a jury that he has to bear the burden of the defense in some states of insanity, or the defense in some states what constitutes self-defense by a preponderance.\nWe have different burdens given on different issues in jury trials all the time.\nNot after we've proven an intentional and an unlawful killing because that definitionally is murder.\nIt does not -- he does not find him innocent in the criminal sense, Your Honor he has committed exactly the same acts.\nBecause there's a matter of -- the fact that we say that if the jury in fact finds him guilty of manslaughter that the state as a matter of simple, call it procedural fairness of dues without any reference to double jeopardy concepts, will not allow the state to retry him for murder.\nAnd that analysis would follow.\nNow this is not a unique approach.\nUnlawful.\nRight.\nIntentionality remains, unlawfulness remains, everything remains but the law has --\nOf everything --\nRight.\nThat's correct, of everything necessary to convict for murder.\nBut the law is a matter of policy would say --\nWell that may be so, but I would maintain that we probably could not under the Maine law, because we would say as a matter of fairness, it's not fair for the state --\nUnder the Maine law of what constitutes fairness, now the issue is never been presented.\nIf it could not be.\nNow, this is not a unique approach.\nI would invite the Court's attention to the statutory scheme of the States of Oregon, Louisiana, the proposed criminal code in Michigan and most notably the State of New York, which to our view treats the proposition exactly the same as we do.\nThey define and take the concept of a single generic offense.\nThey define what they mean by murder and manslaughter and they say specifically in talking about murder that when a person causes a death of another with the intent to cause the death of another person, but he maintains that he does not commit murder because he acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, this constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing to manslaughter in the first degree.\nHowever, this need not be proved by the prosecution initiated -- by the prosecution in any prosecution initiated under the manslaughter provision.\nI'm just -- I'm just citing that for the proposition that the concept of felonious homicide and of voluntary manslaughter as being only a mitigating factor is not unique.\nThank you.\nI believe they proposed in Michigan, the ALI Model Penal Code, they're all in my brief Your Honor.\nA great number do but Maine does not, and that's why we say we're consistent with the theory because self-defense goes to criminality, we require the state to negative.\nI'm not sure if it's in most, but I know in a great many.\nThat's correct.\nAs they view it, we don't view it.\nWe don't view heat of passion of some provocation is going to kill and ever since we do self-defense.\nOh, No.\nI can't say that.\nNo I wouldn't -- Oregon has not done that.\nLeland -- the problem in Leland was that the defendant had to bear the burden beyond a reasonable doubt.\nSubsequently, yes.\nRight, I'm not sure that their analysis is the same Your Honor, but clearly the burdens are.\nI suppose that under the theory that the state could do that, because the absence -- presence or absence of heat of passion is not an element of anything.\nFor penalty.\nThank you.",
    "10": "Herman A. Beilan, Petitioner, versus Board School District of Philadelphia.\nMr. Carroll, you may proceed.\nMr. Carroll -- Mr. Carroll, was there anything in the Pennsylvanian laws about the independence of teachers so far as their political views were concerned and -- and the right of people to interrogate them?\nI thought I saw a subject --\nIn 1944, the date to which this question related, were Communist on the ballot and were they authorized to register in the -- in the State of Pennsylvania and act as other voters do?\nI think you have not exhausted your time.\nYou have 45 minutes.\nWell, no.\nNo, I think -- but he is warning you, you probably told him how much time you want for rebuttal, didn't you?\nYes.\nThat's -- well that's different.[Laughter]\nMr. Rhoads.\nSuppose he had asked him if he was a member of the Republican Central Committee.\nAnd now in -- in 1944, the date to which this question was directed, did the Republican -- did the man have any -- any less right to be a Communist in the State of Pennsylvania than he had to be a Republican?\nAnd did have any less right in 1944 to participate in public elections from a Communist standpoint as they did to a Republican?\nWell, let's -- let's get away from the area like -- like --\n-- Justice Frankfurter had been taking about.\nDid he have any less right to -- did he have any less right in 1944 to register as a Communist, to vote as a Communist, to have -- to engage in political activity as a Communist than he did to register, vote and, engage in Republican problems?\nAll right.\nAll right.\nYes.\nThen why -- why do you make the distinction by saying that it would have been improper for the Superintendent to have asked him if he had been engaged in Republican politics in 1944?\nBut before we get to that, we had -- we had a case recently where the authorities considered the Progressive Party as suspect, and they -- they endeavored to interrogate a man about his activities in the Progressive Party.\nNow suppose that they had asked this man about some activities in the Progressive Party, would you have distinguished that from this case?\nThat's all right.\nIt doesn't (Voice Overlap).\nI would charge him.\nMr. Rhoads, may I ask you this question.\nAssume -- assume that the petitioner had answered that question of the Superintendent and had answered it in the affirmative that in 1944, he had been a member of that -- of that Committee.\nCould they have discharged him for incompetency?\nNo, don't.\nI --\nMr. Rhoads, if -- the thing that I'm trying to get straightened out in my mind is this.\nYou say that this question that the Superintendent asked about Communist affiliations in 1944 when it was legal was entirely pertinent, relevant, and -- and appropriate.\nYou say on the other hand that you -- you think to ask if he was a Republican, at that same time would not have been pertinent and would not have been appropriate.\nI assume that you put the Democrats in the same rule.\nNow, on the other hand, you get somewhere in between when you say, \"Well, I'm not so sure if it was the Progressive Party that you asked about.\nIt might or it might not have been -- been proper.\"\nNow, how or where it -- what is the standard?\nHow -- how is the Board going to determine which party affiliations and activities it can inquire of a teacher about and which party affiliations is it going to -- to say that it cannot inquire about, bearing in mind that you do have a constitutional section which -- which says that no political test of any kind shall be given other -- other than the oath of allegiance which they -- which they take.\nNow, where is the dividing line?\nHow can you say to me that -- that is -- it would be wrong to ask him about being a Republican?\nIt's very doubtful whether it would be or it is at least doubtful whether you could ask him about the Progressive Party and totally proper to ask about the -- the Communist Party which at that time was equally legal with all the others?\nThat was -- that was statutory, wasn't it?\nDo you --\nDo you think that the -- that the Superintendent can manufacture the reasons of his own that way --\n-- independent of the legislature?\nThe legislature in California had done that.\nSo has the municipal government of Los Angeles?\nBut I thought -- I thought that your legislature have prescribed the method, a precise method for testing the loyalty of school teachers.\nAnd -- and had -- it had provided that there were certain procedures that they must go through in order to -- in order to remove a school teacher for disloyalty.\nIf you could --\nWhy then -- why then did they wait all of that time from or the time you gave them the opinion that it constituted incompetence until the next November --\n-- continuing -- continuing to give him a satisfactory report each month on -- on compentency?\nMr. Carroll.\nYou mean the Fifth, they pleaded the Fifth Amendment before the congressional committee?\nAnd then the Philadelphia Court fired them for that alone?",
    "11": "If the Court please.\nI think it might help a little bit if we talked about some concrete facts here in terms of the premiums that were paid.\nThere were three insurance policies and three contemporaneous annuity contracts.\nI think it would be easier if we consider that as one insurance policy totalling $350,000 and an annuity which yielded $8000 and some odd dollars per year.\nThere is no substantial difference between the -- among the three policies, we do not contest the -- any question as to the revocability of the assignments.\nThe formula for issuing these contracts was that the combined premiums for the insurance and the annuity must equal eleven-tenths of the face value of the insurance policy.\nThis decedent pay for $350,000 worth of insurance, $384,000 -- strictly speaking that should be $385,000, there's a discrepancy of $1000 in one of the policy but we will assume since it makes no substantial difference that it was eleven-tenths.\nShe was not required to take any medical examination but the premium for the insurance policy was charged at the regular insurance rates, namely the same rates that would have been charged had she been found medically to be in good health.\nThat premium was a combined total of $314,000.\nThe balance of the total required, namely $384,000, was the total allocable to the annuity and by that I mean as the District Court found that she did not have any choice in how much of an annuity she wanted.\nShe had to purchase an annuity which cost $70,000.\nShe couldn't say I want an annuity that would yield me only $5000 a year.\nThe transaction worked the other way.\nIt worked from the premium end.\nShe had to purchase a $70,000 premium annuity, whatever the yield might be and that is exactly what she did.\nThe reason for this is obvious and in fact it is stated expressly in the findings below.\nThe company required this in order to protect itself in case she died a short time after the policy issue.\nIf that should happen, the company would always have in hand a sum sufficient to pay the insurance.\nThat -- the 10% extra was for loaning charges and commissions as counsel state but even after that, the company always had $350,000 in its possession and was obligated to pay this annuity of $8000 which comes to approximately 2.5% on the investment.\nThat leads us squarely to Helvering versus Le Gierse, which counsel mentioned.\nI would like to state at the outset that this Court in Helvering versus Le Gierse did not solely decide that this was not insurance.\nAt the last page of Mr. Justice Murphy's opinion, after having reached the conclusion that this was not insurance, he states, we now must consider whether it is taxable and he then said it is taxable under Section 302 (c) of a prior Revenue Act which is the predecessor of Section 811 (c) which is the Section we are now dealing with today.\nSo this Court in Le Gierse said that this transaction was taxable under the very same Section we are presently concerned.\nBut it went much further --\nIt -- well in that -- at that time it was Section 302.\nIt's in substance the same, yes, Your Honor.\nThere have been various modifications there since.\nNo, sir.\nThe only difference factually between this case and Le Gierse, and we may straighten that out right now, is that in Le Gierse the decedent still owned the policies at her death, the insurance policy.\nShe had not assigned.\nThat question was -- was manifested throughout, she still held it.\nI'm not saying that Le Gierse has decided this case but I -- I would like to say what it did decide.\nIt did decide under those facts without an assignment that this transaction was taxable and in doing so --\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\nWell, it's a question of what you mean by their interest.\nThey have an interest during the decedent's lifetime, here they have the privilege of surrendering the policy --\nIn this case, no, Your Honor.\nNo, Your Honor.\nIn --\nThe opposite was the fact in Le Gierse.\nI think I -- I will come to why I think that is not a difference.\nThat's right.\nIn Le Gierse, this Court examined it, examined this transaction and said, as counsel stated, that this was an investment, a single investment.\nIt expressly said that although these policies are separate and neither refers to the other and in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, there was no contract with the insurance company which reference was made to both.\nThey were handled with separate application, separate premium payments, separate all the way through and so was it in Le Gierse, that even though these were completely separate -- separate and as Mr. Justice Murphy stated, studiously avoided any reference to each other.\nNevertheless, this Court held that they represented a single investment because the policies counteract each other.\nWhy do they counteract each other is a very simple reason.\nWhen the insurance is purchased from the company's point of view, the company is -- if we may use the word betting that the insured will live a long time.\nWhen it issues an annuity policy it is betting the opposite.\nIt is betting that the annuitant will live a short time.\nThe two counterbalance.\nIf the Court is interested in the appendix to Mr. Justice -- to Judge Clark's opinion in the Third Circuit in Commissioner versus Keller's Estate which was later affirmed by this Court.\nHe has set forth the algebraic computations which prove that the discounted sum necessary to pay the face value of the insurance, plus the discounted sum necessary to pay the annuity always -- always equal to the face value of the policy or as he puts it in terms of a $100.\nHe has set that forth in his opinion and he has the computation.\nThe Government is seeking to tax this as a single investment, Your Honor, from which the income is retained.\nThe insurance is entirely dependent upon the annuity.\nIt could not exist without the annuity.\nTherefore, the whole thing must be taken together as one unit.\nThe -- the income comes from the entire fund, not merely from the annuity portion.\nIt comes from the entire fund and necessarily so because otherwise the company would be gambling with its policy holder's money in attempting to issue insurance in this manner.\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\nIt is an interest which -- for which the rights of the beneficiaries vary from time to time in substantial respects.\nYes, Your Honor.\nBut what this -- what this decedent did as counsel frankly stated was he wanted to transfer $350,000 to -- she wanted to transfer $350,000 to her children.\nIf shecpo did not do so outright and never do in her lifetime were those children entitled to $350,000.\nIf they had surrendered the policy, they would received almost at all times not only less than the face value but less than the premium which she paid for the policy and because --\nIf they had surrendered it, then we would have an entirely different relationship.\nBut the fact --\nThat is right, Your Honor.\nWith this exception, the fact is that the statute says that it taxes income which is retained -- a transfer of property from which income is retained for any period which does not in fact end before death.\nThe fact is here, Your Honor, that the assignees of the policies and beneficiaries at the same time did not surrender these policies.\nThey fulfilled to manifest intention of this decedent to receive the $350,000.\nThe only way they could do that was not to exercise their rights as owners of the policies.We have to take, I think, a realistic view of this transaction.\nIf they had exercised their rights at any time, there would have been a severe penalty upon them financially.\nWell, an interesting point --\nThe contemplation of death theory, Your Honor, I think -- does, Your Honor, mean to take that effect in possession or enjoyment at death?\nBut the reason we could not take that position, Your Honor, is that the subsection of Section 811, which includes those says that such a transfer is taxable only if the decedent held incidence of ownership at the time of her death.\nShe had admittedly no incidence of ownership in this insurance policy.\nWell as, Your Honor, said --\nThat's right, Your Honor.\nBut if we had argued the other way, then Your Honor would have possibly asked me where are the incidents of ownership which she held --\n-- and I would had to say none.\nWe might be.\nYes, Your Honor, I'm fully aware of that and the previous decision of this Court clearly so indicates.\nLe Gierse not only considered the facts as they existed where the policies had not been assigned but it was expressly stated in Le Gierse that no matter who holds these two contracts, they still operate to counteract each other and this is so because the insurance company could not have undertaken to agree, to pay $350,000 for a premium of $314,000 when it had no assurance even if the decedent was in good health.\nThe Bohnen case which leads to the conflict here, we have three circuits which have ruled in the Court with the Government's view, namely the Second, the Third and the Sixth.\nBut the Seventh Circuit in Bohnen said that the fact that the two contracts were issued at the same time and that the policy could have not been obtained without the annuities of no legal significance and that seems to be the basis of its holding.\nYet in Le Gierse, this Court fastened upon that very point to show that that was a single investment.\nAnd I failed to see how this case differs from a straight trust where the decedent reserves to herself the income for life and hasn't created a con -- a vested remainder in her children.\nThat life can -- as the court below appropriately noted, has no rights, or title, or legal interest in the remainder created in favor of the children.\nThe life tenant merely has the income but the two are still interrelated and that certainly is the classic example of the retention of income for life situation which this Court has held taxable.\nIt is interesting also to note that in two states under similar statutes, the same result have been reached similar to those that the Government is now contending.\nThose states are the States of Connecticut and New Jersey where similar combination policies were presented to the Court and a question of a state taxation at both courts held that the two were related, that this was a transfer with the retention of income.\nI might say also in reference to the Goldstone case that in Goldstone, counsel correctly noted that this Court decided the case upon the ground that the decedent had retained a reversionary interest in the policy.\nThe Court at the end of its opinion states that because of this decision, we need not pass upon the Government's alternative contention, that this is taxable as a transfer with income retained for life.\nI would like to point out that we run into a furious situation as a result of this Court's decision in Le Gierse.\nIt is not taxable as insurance because this Court has said in Le Gierse that these combination contracts are not insurance and if this Court reverses the judgment below, it is not taxable in any other fashion.\nTherefore, we have a perfect device for avoidance of any tax with a -- by a bootstrap of lifting up based upon this Court's decision in Le Gierse which was originally designed to prevent the taxpayer from taking advantage of an insurance exemption.\nNow, as to the surrender value, I would like to add one word.\nI think I have partially covered it when I said that the statute is directed to a period which does not in fact end before death and in fact these policies were never surrendered.\nIn addition to that, however, we need not speculate as to what the situation would be.\nCounsel has afforded us I think a very good analogy for our purposes in his brief, where he compares the situation to that of a savings bond which you purchase for $900, which -- that reaches its full value of $1000 in 10 or 12 years.\nAnd he says, suppose that have been transferred to the children, the children can cash that in at any time.\nBut the difference between that case and this case is that in that case, the donor has given only $900 for that bond and the donee never receives less than $900.\nHere, if we take the premium, the decedent paid $314,000 for these three insurance policies.\nIf the children had sought to cash them in shortly after their issuance, they would have received $25,000 less than that amount, and $61,000 less than the face value of the policy.\nAnd even in 1938, they would have received $14,000 less than the premium and $50,000 less than the face value.\nThe cash surrender value never did reach, I must correct counsel on that, never did reach the face value.\nIts higher figure was $326,000 which was still $24,000 below the face value of the policy.\nSo that as the court below noted and has quoted from the New Jersey decision in Bank of New York, it is fantastic to assume that what this decedent really meant to do was an out and out transfer of this insurance policy to her children as a present gift.\nWhat she intended and what everybody to the transaction obviously understood was that this would be held until her death that she would continue to enjoy the income.\nAnd as the Court noted in Le Gierse, and coming back to this interrelation, the Court said in Le Gierse that the only risk the insurance company assumes is an investment risk that the funds which it holds will not earn as much as it has agreed to pay to the annuity.\nIn speaking of that, the Court was referring not to the annuity alone but to the entire fund held at its disposal.\nYes, Your Honor.\nThe difference --\nIf I may, Your Honor, I'd be glad to try and clarify it.\nThe difference is, the petitioner asserts this is an out and out gift.\nn fact he goes so far as to say it's an out and out gift of the cash surrender value.\nThis Court, I might note, has held in Guggenheim versus Rasquin that the cash surrender value is not even the measure of the value of this type of policy.\nThe policy, not the cash surrender value, Your Honor.\nThe policy was given but they say it was an out and out gift of the cash surrender value and of its subsequent accretions, and that it was up to the assignees alone to decide whether it should continue to exist or not.\nWhat I say now, the reason that that becomes important therefore, Your Honor, is that what I'm trying to point out to the Court is that it was never intended that they should exercise any present dominion over this policy, that they -- if they did, it would have cost a severe penalty.\nThis was a strange way to make a gift, where you -- you transfer to your donees property which will net them say $50,000 less than what you had put into it at the same time with no investment laws involved and that is exactly what would have happened here.\nIf they had attempted to realize on their -- on -- on this policy during her lifetime, she would have been penalized by having just contributed to the insurance company, the difference between the cash surrender value and the face value of this policy.\nIt would have taken all the beneficiaries but certainly not, Your Honor.\nAll the beneficiaries would have had to act together, there were four.\nAnd they were joint beneficiaries.\nAll four of them -- yes, certainly not.\nThere was nothing as a matter of law from taking the cash if they had wished to do so --\nAnd I make --\nThat could be so, Your Honor.\nBut as this Court said in Goldstone, we must look at the facts as they exist at the time of death, and at the time of death this policy had not been surrendered, and whether these speculative possibilities might have arisen, the fact is that they did not arise.\nNo, I was referring, Your Honor, to the language about which does not in fact end before his death in the -- in the statute.\nYes, sir.\nThat would have created a wholly new relationship, Your Honor, and I think if I may express my opinion, they would -- the -- the insurance policy is gone, the -- the beneficiaries or assignees have received the cash.\nThe annuity would then become a true annuity in the usual sense, namely, an annuity which has of this -- as its objective the use of income and part of corpus, and possibly speaking there would have been no tax.\nI say possibly for this reason, the Commissioner has taken the position in one case as counsel noted before the tax court that this made no difference.\nThe tax court ruled against him.\nThat case was not appealed and we don't have that problem here since the surrender was not made here.\nYes, sir.\nLegally proper, there is no doubt, Your Honor.\nShe did it and what she did was legally proper.\nIt did, Your Honor.\nThat, Your Honor, depends on where the income is paid from and what I've tried to urge upon, Your Honor, is that this Court itself held in Le Gierse and quite correctly that that is an income upon the whole sum invested, namely, the amount invested in the insurance and in the -- and in the annuity.\nThe company is holding that combined fund.\nThat's how it is enabled to be whole at all times and without laws.\nIt is in form, Your Honor, but as this Court said in Le Gierse, we must look through the forms of the substance of this transaction and this is all one.\nIt certainly is and I would say it was even greater, Your Honor, had not this Court said that no matter who held the policy the result would be the same and that is I think the effect of your language, not of yours, I'm sorry --\n-- the Court language in -- in Le Gierse.\nThat --\nNo, Your Honor.\nI must respectfully disagree.\nI would say that the substance is that she put this money away, as if she had put it in a bank and said to the bank, \"Pay me the income from this during my lifetime.\nPay my beneficiaries the principal at my death.\"\nNow, I -- in fact in my brief I thought of another analogy which is an analogy where you create a trust with a life income to yourself and a remainder to your children, with the privilege in your children to discount the remainder in advance by withdrawing a lesser amount.\nIf the children do not withdraw that amount but leave it there until death, then this is squarely a remainder with a life estate which is the classic situation, that this Section 811 (c) is designed to tax.\nI failed to see that there's any substantial difference here and that coming again to Your Honors prior question is that what this transaction -- and that was why I was talking about the difference in value that this shows that this decedent intended that this money stay there during her life and that the children would leave it there during her life.\nShe put no legal string on it.\nNo, Your Honor, that is quite true.\nFor the reasons which I have stated, I respectfully submit judgment should be affirmed.Thank you.",

the preemption might have even been broader without it, but it preserves State laws relating to railroad safety until the Secretary covered the subject matter, and that--\n--Yes, Your Honor, it is fairly common, but the language used... the language Congress chose... we have to assume they knew the meaning of what they were saying.\nYour Honor, I classify it as such because it says that State law is preserved relating to railroad safety, and then when it says what's preempted, what does it say?\nThe Secretary has to cover the subject matter, not... the Secretary didn't say, well, when the Secretary passes a regulation that relates to railroad safety.\nThe Congress said cover the subject matter.\nThat's why I say the statute is narrowly drawn.\nIt's also supported by the legislative history, Your Honor.\nThe legislative history in a railroad congressional hearing addressing Federal and State roles under the FRSA... this is what Congress said.\nThe States may adopt or continue in force any law, rule, regulation, et cetera, until the Secretary has promulgated a specific rule.\nThis prevents the mere enactment of a broad authorizing Federal statute from preempting the field.\nThen to ensure even more that State law wouldn't be arbitrarily displaced, they included the local safety hazard exception, which says States may adopt rules, regulations that the Secretary has already covered when there's a local safety hazard and it's not incompatible with the Federal rule and it's not an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nReading this and then reading it as this Court always does in light of its stated purpose, the purpose of the FRSA, not as CSX would have you believe, is not uniformity.\nCongress described the purpose as this act to promote safety in all areas of railroad operations and reduce accidents and deaths and injuries caused by railroad related accidents and to reduce damage caused by any accidents involving any carrier of hazardous materials.\nAnd that's very important when we talk about speed.\nThe Secretary has not covered the two subject matters at issue here under the express terms of section 434 read in light of its stated purpose.\nWith regard to speed, first of all, section 213 does not regulate what the State's common law regulates.\nIt does not cover it.\nIt may relate to speed, but it doesn't completely cover the subject matter.\nThe scope of the act... the beginning of it says--\n--No, Your Honor.\nYes, Your Honor.\nOnly the congressional history says completely, but it doesn't say relating to either, and it doesn't say addressing.\nAnd Congress could have chosen those words.\nCongress said cover.\nAnd that does not cover the subject matter.\nThe beginning of section 213, Your Honor, says this is all about track safety standards, and it says, well, we're going to govern the geometry.\nWe're going to govern the roadbed.\nWe're going to govern the number and the quality of crossties along a section of track.\nThen Congress comes up and says now, based on these factors, how many crossties you have, based on how much... how many joints and rails and all this kind of stuff, they say we're going to classify this section of track right here at Cartersville, Georgia as class 4.\nA class 4 track you can travel across based on track structure, geometry, and all that... you can travel across it at 60.\nNow, if the railroad wants to upgrade it to a class 6, they can travel at 110.\nNow, then you can see that they were addressing one thing.\nYou can read it from the text of that act.\nThey were governing how fast a train can travel and not derail, and that's all--\n--Absolutely.\nYes, Your Honor.\nAccording to section--\n--Your Honor, I don't know what the national maps show.\nI will tell you that if this Court finds that speed is preempted under this section, the only thing that has to be considered in traveling 110 is whether you're sitting on a class 6 track, and that doesn't have anything to do with grade crossing safety, weather, fog, schools in the nearby area, high volumes of traffic going across the area, nothing that the common law controls.\nYou can see also--\n--Yes, Your Honor, and in most cases they do.\nOurs is... our case is common law.\nThere's a lot of cases out there that did deal with municipal ordinances, and those cases held that it was preempted, but not preempted for the reasons--\n--The local speed ordinances because they said they--\n--In the lower courts.\nThat's what the lower courts were saying, but they were--\n--I believe, Your Honor, that ordinance is not preempted.\nIt does not... this section 213 does not cover the subject matter of that requirement because that requirement would be based on the same factors as the State's common law, the traffic--\n--Yes, Your Honor, and I understand the concern that you're getting at.\nBut the purpose of the FRSA is not to burden interstate commerce... to place... take a burden away.\nThe purpose is to promote safety.\nWouldn't it be counterproductive to allow the railroads to travel at 110 miles an hour through Cartersville, Georgia at a crossing with 150 feet of sight distance, that they have these trucks going over all the time?\nHe sure could.\nThat's absolutely right, Your Honor.\nHe certainly could.\nI'm not--\n--No, sir, he has not, and I'm not certain how long he'd be Secretary if he did because the headlines, if they said... can you imagine saying Congress says we can travel 110 miles an hour across... through grade crossings on all railroad tracks in the United States.\nHow likely would it be that it would have been passed?\nThen, also to support that this regulation only covers derailments and track classification is Senate report 91-6--\n--That would be great, Your Honor, but 65 percent of the crossings out there have no active protection at all.\nIt's both very important, Your Honor.\nAs far as--\n--Yes, sir.\n[Laughter]\nI know what you mean.\nOne of the witnesses in this case was kind of upset because she didn't get to get her free bag of coffee by getting to the grocery store at a certain time, and so she was very aggravated by this.\nBut, Your Honor--\n--Yes, it is.\nAbsolutely, Your Honor, and it is a safety factor.\nHowever, the Secretary noted in the reports to Congress that it's also a safety factor to have these trains slow down because of the common sense involved.\nThe slower the train is going, the more time that the motorist has to perceive the train's presence and to react to it, like at this crossing with only 150 feet of sight distance.\nAt 35 miles an hour, it was upon Mr. Easterwood in 3.2 seconds.\nImagine if you doubled that to 60 miles an hour.\nYour Honor, as far as if a gate arm always were in place at every crossing in Georgia, and we had unlimited Federal funds and could just put them everywhere, and they always worked properly, they didn't ever malfunction, and they didn't ever give false warnings, and they didn't ever do any of those things, you're right.\nSpeed would not be an issue, but that's not the reality of it, sir.\nThe reality of it is that there's not gate arms at every crossing.\nIn fact, most of them there's not.\nMany of the crossings are not even a recipient of Federal funds because they're not public crossings to begin with.\nYour Honor, if the crossing has been improved--\n--We look at those, the gate arm regulations, strictly as funding regulations.\nThat's all they are.\nEvery one of them--\n--No preemption, sir.\nAnd as Justice O'Connor pointed out, they would have an excellent defense if they did what was required by 646.214 in State law... in State court.\nAnd what jury is going to hold them liable for doing no more than they were allowed to do?\nThat's the way our system works.\nYour Honor, I believe in the jury system.\nI believe in the jury system completely, and I do believe that more times than not they do the right thing.\nAnd they know that when you put gate arms up and the State says that's enough, they have enough sense to know that you don't hold them liable just because you got a poor, little old lady over here that doesn't have a husband anymore.\nThey have sympathy, but not that much.\nI know because I'm in front of juries all the time.\nNow, these are funding regulations, and funding regulations, Your Honor, do not displace State tort law unless they do so with such explicitness that the States know by accepting Federal funds how much of their law was going to be displaced.\nThat's not the case here.\nEvery regulation cited applies to Federal fund projects.\nThe prioritization is to receive Federal funds; even the Secretary states her position... or his position as overseer to ensure that Federal money is appropriately spent.\nThe regulations that were promulgated by the Secretary did just that, ensure that Federal money is appropriately spent and, of course, the Federal Government wants to do that.\nAnd why do they give it to the States?\nYou all were asking that question earlier.\nWhy do they give it to the States and doesn't that preempt?\nNo.\nThey don't have a mechanism for giving it directly to the railroad.\nIt has to go through the States.\nNo, sir, not the private crossings at all.\nJust the public crossings.\nThat would be possible--\n--Well, maybe they do.\nMaybe they do take the rinky-dink ones, and they don't worry about those, the ones that are out in the country.\nWell, they're supposed to look at them all.\nThey're supposed to look at them all.\nI don't know how in practice it actually works.\nBut think about that, Your Honor.\nThink about if you accept the Solicitor General's argument, is that once that Federal money is spent, you're preempted.\nThen every time that diagnostic team walks down a section of track, down any area in, say, 10 miles and they see three or four crossings, just because they walked down there and their salaries were paid with Federal funds, you're preempted according to the Solicitor General, which would... that can't be.\nIt can't be.\nTake the situation here where a motion detector was--\n--Your Honor, Mr. Trienens was correct up to a point, that they did decide... they did put it... well, let me say this.\nThey put a motion detector years ago, and the reason why they put the motion detector is they were upgrading four crossings.\nWhen they upgraded those four crossings, they decided to put gate arms at all of them, and that included Cook Street.\nThey wanted to do that.\nBut they started at West Avenue.\nI wish I could.\nThere were, but they were used to improve the West Avenue crossing because the motion detector at Cook Street wouldn't work with the new circuitry at West Avenue.\nSo, yes, Federal funds were spent to put a motion detector at Cook Street some years ago, but it wasn't for the safety of Cook Street.\nIt was to make the West Avenue circuitry work because you have to change it all.\nIt's all tied in together.\nSo--\n--Yes, sir.\nThat's why it's such a complicated answer.\nNow, as far as the gate arms and the city saying no, you're not going to do that, I want to tell you what happened.\nWhat happened was is it is big, and they said you can't put an island here because we have lots of tractor-trailer traffic.\nAnd it is.\nIt's an industrial area, and you know how wide they have to turn when making a turn.\nIf they put an island in the middle of it, they couldn't have negotiated that turn.\nSo, they said you got to put extended gate arms on, the longer ones.\nAnd the railroad said, well, then we got to raise our communication lines because they're going to interfere.\nAnd they said, okay, we'll do it, and everybody went on their merry way.\nAnd nobody ever did anything.\nThe railroad never reported back that they had completed raising their communication lines.\nThen Mr. Easterwood is killed, and they're saying, boom, you're preempted because you wouldn't let us do it.\nIt's not the case.\nThat's definitely not the case.\nAnd that shows that if you find that these are anything other than funding regulations how difficult the question is going to be in the lower courts as to when preemption starts, when it ends, what it turns on, the lapse.\nIs there a lapse?\nIs that a problem?\nIt's just common sense that these are nothing but funding regulations that do not supplant State tort law.\nYes, sir, they are.\nThe States are given a certain amount of funds, and part of it's used for the surveying process, some to pay the diagnostic team.\nAnd so there you go.\nThe diagnostic team walks down the track.\nBoom, you're preempted under that analysis.\nThe Secretary in the reports to Congress noted that because the railroad does have tort liability in cases such as... in railroad crossing accidents, this continues, a just... a continuing interest... excuse me.\nThis justifies a continuing interest on the part of the railroad in the total safety effort.\nIf they were to be preempted, Your Honors, from placing gate arms at a hazardous crossing, it would remove all incentive to improve safety, and that would be in direct opposition to the purpose of the Federal Railroad Safety Act.\nI'm sorry, Justice Scalia, you had a question.\nOkay.\nNeither in this case is there implied preemption, and I... correct me if I'm pronouncing this wrong, but in Cipollone, it... you all agreed that if you have an express preemption provision, this causes you to not have to look at whether it occupies the field because just by there being a provision, it's assumed that Congress did not want to go any further than what was stated in the provision.\nSo far as conflict preemption, there is no conflict here either, Your Honors.\nCSX, first of all, can easily comply with both of the State requirements at issue here.\nFirst of all, the Solicitor General and the railroad makes the argument that... its counter on the speed argument is because emergency braking will place them in a position where that would cause a derailment, and they all concede that this was aimed at derailments.\nSection 213 was aimed at derailments.\nEmergency braking is not the question here.\nIf you slow down to what's reasonable, you shouldn't ever have to emergency brake.\nAnd a point that came out earlier during Mr. Trienens' argument was very interesting, the fact that the proper lookout claim still remains in this case.\nThe proper lookout claim couldn't possibly remain if the speed is preempted because--\n--Yes, Your Honor.\nThat kind of makes the State requirement superfluous.\nYou know, well, there he goes.\n[Laughter]\nAnd that would not make sense.\nI'm sorry.\nThe Secretary... well, let me state then also it is supported in the legislative history that these were just for derailments, and that's all they were for is for derailments.\nIn Senate report 91-619, the Senate members were talking about recent catastrophes that had happened from derailments, and they cited one case, one example, where a car derailed.\nAnd it was carrying hazardous chemicals, and it caused an explosion.\nThe explosion destroyed the city's major industry.\nIt destroyed several homes, and it contaminated the water supply for several months.\nThen they found out that a $50 track repair would have made... caused that derailment not to occur, that that would have happened.\nIf... Congress, the Senate members, noted that because of that, they thought that the derailments were caused by poor track conditions combined with highe average speeds.\nMr. Parker pointed out to me this morning in the USA Today, the bottom, left-hand corner, an article says 69 percent of train accidents are derailments.\nThe Secretary in section 213 was only regulating Congress' perceived cause of these terrible derailments that happen so frequently, poor track conditions combined with higher average speeds.\nThank you.\nWell, Your Honor, under their interpretation, they say that they don't.\nIn fact, in their reply brief... it amazed me... they said we still have the duty to slow down to avoid a collision.\nWhat's the difference between slowing down to avoid a collision, a specific collision--\n--Yes, Your Honor.\nYes, Your Honor, and--\n--Right, but--\n--That is all they're saying, but what we're doing with the railroad is no more than we're doing with a truck driver on I-75.\nIf he comes to an area where the lanes narrow down into one because they're doing construction, we require him to slow down, to not kill somebody.\nWe don't pat him on the back and say that's okay.\nIt is, and now they're saying in their reply brief that they have the duty to slow down.\nAnd that's what's inconceivable to me, Your Honor, is I don't see what the difference is in slowing down to avoid a specific collision and slowing down to avoid a collision because you're in a dangerous area.\nBut they--\n--Right.\nOr--\n--Yes, Your Honor.\nThat's right.\nAnd if they knew... by that same reasoning, if they knew that there was a little path there because it was a national park and pedestrians, people, frequently and bicyclers frequently went over the tracks there to go into the other part of the national park, would they then not have a duty to know that that hazard is up there and that it's very likely that an accident could occur because the conditions are so bad and not slow down.\nIt's inconceivable, Your Honor, that the Secretary would pass a regulation like that in the name of safety.\nThank you.",
    "14": "Could I ask you if you had, say, in 1972 on 3, you had gone to the Commission and asked for a rate increase, saying that you were contractually permitted to increase the rates and please give us permission to charge a higher rate, and the Commission had said fine, that's fine, now, that certainly would have been permission for you prospectively to file, to charge higher rates?\nIs the Commission authorized to give retroactive effect to any rate increase?\nSo, the question that my brother Brennan asked you, was, do you interpret the Commission's response to what you did file as saying, we consent to your charging higher rates from 1961 up to... I don't think they have the authority to make rate increases retroactive.\nI understand that.\nEven if it were conceded that the contract permitted you to... if there was no question whatsoever about that, the Commission would... the most the Commission could do is say, prospectively, you may charge higher rates?\nWell, that's the problem.\nAs I understand the Commission, the Commission opposes the result you want to reach here?\nAnd on the ground that this would undercut their authority despite the claim of... your claim based on the equities, and despite your in effect claiming estoppel--\n--Or misrepresentation or whatever?\nAnd the Commission... that's the Commission's position, isn't it?\nFrom '72 on?\nAt least, any producer who was a small producer entitled to be exempt from filing?\nThere is some argument about whether all of them are or not?\nSo, from '72 on, it didn't make any difference whether--\n--Well, the Commission position is, though, from '61 to '72, as to the dry gas residue, you're not entitled to any--\nWhen was the waiver appeal taken?\nWhen was it filed in the Court of Appeals?\nThat was after... that was after we granted certiorari?\nThis year, did we?\nSo we knew that the waiver had been denied?\nIs there any argument in this case about... or I'll put it the other way... must we decide whether these companies are small companies that are freed from the filing requirements as of '72?\nIs there an issue about that?\nBut you mean, if someone is a small producer, then from '72 on there is no dispute?\nWell, then, it'd all go back to the state court?\nWhy is that?\nI thought the Commission in this very case said that to the extent these companies are small producers, then it's up to the state court after '72?\nBut... the Commission washed its hands of the whole matter then, with respect to post-'72 rate increase?\nI don't want to extend your time, Mr. Goldberg.",
    "15": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI will frame the issue just a little bit differently, because I think the issue that this Court is presented with here is whether Conrail's distrust of the twin pillars of the American justice system... and that is the jury and the adversarial system... should persuade this Court to ignore the text of the FELA and the broad remedial purposes as... as the commitments of this Court over almost the last century have revealed, to ignore genuine, severe and foreseeable injury resulting from the negligence of the railroad.\nLet me, because of the position that I stand in, address some questions.\nFirst, Petitioner said that there was no duty in 1908 to avoid emotional injury at common law.\nThat's incorrect.\nAnd he ignores the case of Dulieu v. White & Son, which is actually a King's Bench case in 1901.\nI apologize I did not cite it, and I can provide, by letter, the cite.\nIt was--\n--Yes, Your Honor, I believe that is correct.\nHowever, as I think that we, as common law lawyers approach common law, I believe the common law would embody both... and... and I'll get to your question in a little different way, contrasting whether--\n--Absolutely.\nAnd let me go right to... to your... to the answer to your question.\nAnd that's Spade v. Lynn and Massachusetts Railroad, which was... which was the American case that was specifically addressed by Just... Judge Kennedy... excuse me... of the King's Bench in Dulieu, in which... in Spade v.... v. Lynn and Massachusetts Railroad, they recognized that there was a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid emotional injury.\nBut the court said in Spade, we have a problem of the administration of these claims... the same argument that Conrail is making here... we have a difficulty of proof.\nAnd what the resolution of the issue before this Court is, is really a matter of proof.\nIn the Carlisle case, we marshalled a trial, and the jury decided that Conrail ignored the 1929 studies that revealed the dangerous medical consequences, bodily consequences, that... that occurred as a result of unreasonable stress on the job without visual assistance; they ignored the 1974 report of the FRA, which confirmed those results; they ignored the 1987 assessment of the very office that found the conditions there hazardous, that found the staff inadequate, that found the work excessive, that found that there was no visual assistance whatsoever to assist train dispatchers who were making moment-to-moment decisions that could involve wholesale catastrophe.\nAnd that leads me--\n--Good question, because that brings me over to Justice O'Connor, who I think asked a question, isn't there another remedy here?\nNo, Your Honor.\nThe remedy that... that in fact the Petitioner is arguing for before this Court is to exclude an entire class of employees, an entire class of injuries, from any remedy whatsoever.\nAnd I might point out that they absolutely misstate the law with respect to Workmen's Compensation in the United States.\nThe law of Workmen's Compensation in the United States, every other worker in any other industry would have recovery for an emotional injury which was foreseeable and was an essential consequence of their type of job.\nBut let's talk a little bit about the zone of danger that I think--\n--Judge, I... I believe I've cited--\n--Goyden v.... I forget the defendant's name... a New Jersey case, which essentially holds that if in fact the emotional injury is causally related to an essential aspect of that employee's work, that emotional injury is fully compensable.\nThat's why--\n--Judge... Justice, let me please comment on that.\nBecause, actually, if you look at the law of Workmen's Compensation in this area... for instance, the case of Hammerle, which is the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation that recognizes the compensability of emotional injury, the test is: Was the emotional illness a reasonable reaction to an abnormal working circumstance?\nWhich, actually, it is the... the only Workmen's Compensation type of case in Pennsylvania that actually requires proof of fault... proof of showing that the condition was abnormal.\nSo, it's very interesting in this area that in... in the emotional recovery area in Workmen's Comp, the test does include the reasonable person test, which is a negligence concept.\nAnd that is, this is not a... a subjective reaction, it is an objective test in Workmen's Compensation.\nSo, I... I come... I cite the issue with some hesitancy, because of the knee-jerk reaction of railroads generally to the mention of Workmen's Compensation.\nBut I mention it because of Justice O'Connor's question, so that this Court understands that what Conrail is really arguing here is that an entire class of genuine, foreseeable, real and severe injuries go completely uncompensated in the face of the clear language of the statute in 1908 that every injury suffered at the hands of the negligence of the railroad, in whole or in part, should be in fact compensated.\nAnd there's a couple of other points that I want to make as a matter of proof.\nThis Court has recently addressed the issue, and actually reaffirmed its faith and its confidence in the American adversary system and in the jury in the case of Dalbert, and also in the case of... Harris.\nBut--\n--If I might return to the initial discussion that I had about the Dulieu case, Judge, I... Justice, I believe that it was in fact a duty that existed at common law that, at the time of the Spade v. Lynn and Massachusetts decision, there were these concerns about the administration... that is, fraudulent claims and unforeseeable liability or... excuse me... potential liability... caused the court to adopt certain crutches that in fact were really examples of meritorious cases.\nWe have now developed medical science to such a point... and the adversarial system allows the medical science... the competing medical views of the causation, of the seriousness of an emotional injury, under the reasonable man standard, to compete in the marketplace of the courtroom, and to allow the jury, with proper instructions, to decide what, in fact, Spade v. Lynn kind of threw up its hands and say, we'll use these crutches, the physical impact doctrine.\nLet me also make a point--\n--Let me... let me make a point under the Restatement.\nI think it was a point that actually Justice Ginsburg kind of hinted at.\nAnd that is that, frankly, under the Restatement, specifically, 313, if in fact a reasonable person would foresee that their conduct would result in emotional distress that would result in bodily harm, that that is injury.\nOur position, the petition of the Respondents in this case, is that injury, as used in the statute, means both mental and physical injury.\nAnd, frankly, as this Court said in Urie, there is nothing in the statute that would indicate an intention to exclude any class of injuries or class of employees, and... and any attempt to read in such a limitation would be, quote, sheer inference.\nAnd... and, Your Honor, I think one of the other points that I want to make with respect to the... the issue of the--\n--Let me address that--\n--Your Honor, the problem with zone of danger tests... and I think it was a question that... that Justice Kennedy asked... is that it is so fortuitous.\nIf in fact Mr. Gottshall--\n--I don't believe that we can.\nI think the answer is that... that... that Your Honors, obviously, I believe, are... are here, and I... I... with respect to Justice Rehnquist, Chief Justice Rehnquist's question, I believe, theoretically, that... that this remedy is a dynamic remedy, and this Court, consistent with guidance from the common law or medical science, could contract the remedy, as well as... as expand it.\nHowever, consistent with medical science as well as the development of common law... and common law courts all across this country, with respect to recovery for emotional injury, it has been expanding.\nWith respect to the ability to identify, to measure, to scientifically present and defend the existence of real emotional injury, it has expanded.\nSo, Your Honor, I... I believe he's not writing it out of the statute.\nI think Justice Scalia properly... he's picking the test which is the most... the broadest test, which allows him to win in both of these cases.\nBut it is completely fortuitous.\nIt is overinclusive and underinclusive at the same time, just as a physical impact test.\nIf you remember Roscoe Pound, 75 years ago, made the very same point, that it's absolutely fortuitous... if there's a... if there's a jostling... in the case from Pennsylvania, Zelinsky, an automobile passenger in an absolute bump in a parking lot, who is jostled, is then able to collect for... for a full range of emotional injury because of the magical coincidence of the cars having touched.\nAnd there... there are... are'a myriad of examples, Justice Kennedy, using it in the Gottshall case, if in fact, Mr. Gottshall had fallen on the way to help, then there would have been the contemporaneous physical injury and, magically, he would have fallen within the test.\nI have to, because I represent Alan Carlisle, make another point.\nThe congressional history, the House of Representatives, with respect to the Boiler Inspection Act, also indicated that their intention was not only to protect and place the human overhead that the railroad consumed in its wake on its employees on the railroad, it also indicated that a purpose was to protect us, the public.\nAnd this is where Alan Carlisle comes in.\nBecause Alan Carlisle is in the operations aspect of a dynamic transportation injury... industry... the movement of hazardous materials that involve catastrophe that would, in fact, compromise entire communities.\nMy client's stress was not fear for himself.\nMy client's stress was fear for whole communities; that he was being asked to make moment-to-moment decisions about catastrophe with inadequate, outdated commit... equipment, which was proven by a Government study of the exact office and the exact defendant at the very same time, which they ignored.\nAre we, as a court, to ignore the stress and inevitable bodily consequences on an employee in a... air traffic controllers... that's the analogous... the analogous position that my client would be in if he was in the airline industry.\nThey work 20 minutes and then... then take a break.\nMy client worked 15 and 16 hours a day, 16 days in a row under abusive supervisors, with no visual assistance.\nAnd his concerns were that he was going to kill somebody... not only that he was going to kill somebody, but that he was going to see his face on the front page not of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", but of the \"London Times\", because his... his mistake could compromise an entire community because of the hazardous material.\nLet me move just a second to my closing remarks.\nWe cannot use 18th and 19th century crutches, such as the physical impact rule, to resolve 20th and 21st century work place problems.\nIn Dalbert, this Court... and it's actually the test in the Third Circuit... that the scientific validity of the medical evidence in emotional duress test cases, the gatekeeping function of... of the Federal court judges can in fact identify the reliability of that validity.\nAnd if in fact it meets that test, then those... that expert testimony, which in both these cases, the injuries are supported with, substantiated by medical expert testimony, in my case, liability... that is, that a reasonable person under the same circumstances, normally constituted, would have suffered the same or similar injuries, by Dr. Paul Rouech, who is in fact a consultant for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, found... was the expert on liability in the Carlisle case.\nI am asking this Court to affirm the decisions below, and affirm our confidence and our commitment, and reject, and not be counseled by the fears that Conrail would like to in fact share with us, and affirm our belief in the working ability of American juries and of the adversary system to find the truth and to compensate the meritorious case, which was in fact both the text and the legislative history.\nThank you very much.",
    "16": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the questions that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer raised about the effectiveness of section 1981 if there is no right to bring an action for retaliation.\nSection 1981 doesn't provide any specific remedies or any type of enforcement mechanism.\nIt can only be enforced through a private lawsuit.\nPetitioner's basically asking this Court to allow an employer to be able to fire an employee who brought a private lawsuit to enforce his section 1981 rights.\nIf the Court were to allow employers to do that, then any employer or contracting party would have the ability to exempt themselves from section 1981 liability.\nTake the example of a person who complains that he was not promoted because of his race in violation of section 1981.\nHis employer fires him for making that complaint.\nIf he did not have protection under section 1981 against retaliation, he would never have the opportunity to remedy that discriminatory promotion.\nThey would in fact have a cause of action, Justice Scalia.\nBut this Court--\n--This Court held in the Jackson case that discrimination on the basis... that retaliation when there was a complaint about sex discrimination constituted discrimination on the basis of sex.\nSo it follows that here under section 1981 if someone makes a complaint about race discrimination and they are retaliated against that they are being discriminated against on the basis of race.\nWell, that's what the Court held in Jackson, Your Honor.\nThere's a lot of reasons to bring a Title VII action, Your Honor.\nTitle VII allows an employee to go to the EEOC, and the EEOC has a lot of advantages.\nAnd so you can bring both a Title VII and a section 1981 claim.\nThat's correct.\nThat's correct.\nCongress said specifically in... in the 1991 Civil Rights Act that the damage caps do not apply if an employee has a right under section 1981 and so--\n--Well... and we do have the right that's at issue here today, because--\n--Title VII damages were added, compensatory and punitive damages were added, in the 1991 Civil Rights Act.\nThat's right.\nThat's absolutely--\n--That's correct.\nAnd Congress clearly made that... made that choice.\nThe words in the statute that provide the basis for this claim is that you are entitled to the same rights to make and enforce contracts as white citizens.\nAnd this Court has consistently interpreted that to mean--\n--That's correct.\nWhat the Court did to help our case was that after Patterson was decided and before the section... before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed, the lower courts had interpreted Patterson to restrict retaliation claims because they generally involve post formation conduct.\nAnd what Congress made clear in the... in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is that they wanted to have protection throughout the entire contractual relationship.\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's correct.\nThat's absolutely right, Justice--\n--They consistently thought there was a cause of action for retaliation based upon Sullivan.\nThe words of the statute that help us establish the cause of action are that it made... that Congress made clear that the entire contractual relationship would be covered from the beginning of the contractual relationship through the end, through termination.\nAnd coupling that with the original words of the statute that lower courts had interpreted to allow a cause of action for retaliation and with subsection (c), which uses broader language, it says \"impairment by discrimination\"... under this Court's holding in Jackson--\n--Any of those could apply, Justice Kennedy.\nBut the... what Congress was legislating against was this Court's restriction in Patterson and saying that the rights that are protected are only those rights at the making of the contract and the enforcement of the contract.\nAnd they expanded the language to cover the entire contractual relationship.\nSo that, for example, here where you have a termination caused by retaliation, then you would have a cause of action for retaliation under the statute.\nPatterson said you were wrong.\nThere were--\n--They based that on... on this Court's reading in Sullivan.\nAnd Sullivan interpreted the companion statute to section 1981, which was section 1982.\nThat's correct, Justice Breyer.\nI would agree with that.\nWell, I would disagree with that respectfully, Justice Kennedy.\nI would say here, when you have the person who was the victim of the discrimination, who was also, who was complaining about the discrimination and then gets fired, he's in actually a better position than the white homeowner was in Sullivan.\nThose statutes--\n--The word \"retaliation\".\n--does not appear in... in those.\nThere's actually very few Federal statutes where the actual word \"retaliation\" appears.\nBut the other statutes that--\n--They do, but there is no specific cause of action provided in section 1981 at all.\nAnd this Court has already held that there is a private cause of action under section 1981, and what we're asking--\n--I think you give effect to Sullivan in this situation, and the reason is because at the time that Congress was legislating and amending section 1981, and it was acting against the backdrop of this Court's jurisprudence, it had Patterson in front of it, it had... it knew that Sullivan was still good law.\nIt knew that this Court had repeatedly directed that section 1981 and section 1982 be construed similarly; and Patterson did not address the specific situation that was in Sullivan, that is whether you could bring a cause of action for retaliation.\nThat's correct.\nBut--\n--If they were legislating on a clean slate I might agree with that Justice... Chief Justice Roberts.\nBut in this situation they were not legislating on a clean slate.\nWhat they were doing was amended one of the oldest civil rights acts in this country, the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\nAnd given that they were going to amend that law and they amended it based upon what this Court had said in Patterson, and I think under those circumstances it... they wouldn't necessarily go and create and write a reticulated statute such as the modern antidiscrimination statutes are.\nI don't know that that's necessarily true.\nI think they... they legislated against the backdrop both of Sullivan and the lower courts' consistent recognition of a cause of action.\nI wouldn't necessarily agree with that, Justice Alito.\nI would--\n--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg; and at that time this Court said that you look to the language of the statute, and there in Title IX the language was broad.\nIt was a general ban on discrimination, such as we have in section 1981 and section 1982, and in fact the Jackson court relied on Sullivan and relied on this Court's interpretation of Sullivan to find that there was a cause of action for retaliation under Title IX.\nWell, the Court has already implied a cause of action and the question is whether--\n--Well, the language in this statute that guarantees the same rights to make and enforce contracts by citizens provides that basis, based on this Court's decision in Jackson.\nI'm sorry.\nI didn't hear... I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Justice Kennedy.\nBut... subsection (b) defines make and enforce more broadly.\nAnd that was the purpose of the language in section 1981(d), that was to make clear that the terms make and enforce contracts cover the entire contractual relationship, from the beginning of the relationship to the end of it.\nAnd I know there is some disagreement about that, but the Court in Jackson found that... it did find that Sullivan did stand for the proposition that there was a cause of action for retaliation.\nWell, if you look at what Sullivan actually said, Chief Justice Roberts, I think you would find that you could read it more expansively that just a third party standing case.\nIn that case the white lessor, Mr. Sullivan, had been expelled from the corporation after he advocated the rights of his black lessee, Mr. Freeman; and he was allowed under... the Court allowed him to bring his action to recover damages and get injunctive relief, because he himself was expelled from that corporation.\nSo he was the person that had an had injury in that circumstance.\nSo I think that it's not--\n--The... the Court says that Mr. Sullivan does have standing to bring the action.\nI do agree with that, but if you read the entire opinion, you would see that they also say that Mr. Sullivan had the right to bring his action for damages and injunctive relief.\nJust to sum up, because this Court in Sullivan and Jackson has recognized that persons who themselves were not victims of discrimination must be protected against retaliation when they advocate the rights of those victims; otherwise the underlying discrimination would go unchecked... we are not asking the Court to do anything here that they haven't already done.\nWe are just asking that the victim of the discrimination here, Mr. Humphries, have the same protection against retaliation that this Court has already recognized that his advocate would have.\nThank you.",
    "17": "Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court: We do believe there are errors that are so basic that they require a reversal automatically.\nAnd certainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for 2 years that violated no law.\nIt's almost unimaginable and it's unheard of.\nThere are very few cases that even come close to resembling--\n--That's--\n--What's so important about that, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have been convicted on that evidence.\nThe court would have instructed that this evidence was received--\n--But here, Your Honor, all this evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was convicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an awful lot of force to our argument here is that the government has conceded that he could have been convicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct alone.\nThat that was--\n--Well, Your Honor, I understand that, but I certainly -- I'd like to say first, in terms of the concession that was made here, you are talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a trial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly dynamic.\nThe one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I think cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it cannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years.\nAnd -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a matter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance to, the last question the jury asked of the judge: We want to know what constitutes labor.\nAnd they put in their note the -- the largest task of all, the building and the designing of the Web site and then maintaining it.\nAnd that was all pre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment.\nIt was out for 7 days, Your Honor.\nSeven days the jury deliberated over this case.\nBut -- but, Your Honor, I wanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that says that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the probative value.\nI think if we could take ourselves back to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said, Your Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background evidence, I -- I think there's a good likelihood that it would have been excluded.\nI don't think you can say--\n--Sorry to hear that, Your Honor.\nBut in the -- in the course of taking in some evidence as background, I don't think it's ever been of this magnitude in a unique case where the evidence that's coming in bears directly on the liability.\nAnd I think the -- the question is terribly important because, obviously, it shows the jury was focused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the forced labor.\nWell--\n--Well--\n--Yes.\nWell, one point you make, Your Honor, that I--\n--It's certainly welcome, and that is that we are seeking a retrial here.\nYou know, you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was post-enactment.\nBut in response to Your Honor's question, I think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the jury, and they saw all of this proof with no instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the -- the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in front of that had to have a--\n--Oh, I'm sorry.\nYour Honor, I think -- and I choose my words carefully -- I think that this test under this circumstance was justified.\nWhen the court saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if there was any possibility that the jury relied exclusively--\n--I think -- to answer Your Honor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and that is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made it very clear, we're only applying this test to ex post facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if there was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct -- the jury could have based their verdict exclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new trial.\nThe -- the Olano test, Your Honor?\nWell, the possibility test has been used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case.\nIt has also been used in several States--\n--Georgia being one.\nYes.\nYes, Your Honor.\nAnd--\n--In the -- in this very narrow category, Your Honor.\nWell--\n--Your Honor, as I know, you are aware of the Marks case.\nThey held that the ex post facto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and that was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well.\nBut I think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and -- and weight of the ex post facto law is present here.\nThe Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex post facto implications.\nWhat you are doing is, you're taking conduct that violates no law before the law is passed, and you're taking--\n--Your Honor, that's right.\nIt -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's an extremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2 years of conduct to come into a case--\n--Well, if it was -- Your Honor, my stand--\n--My argument is, Your Honor, that no person in this country under our Constitution should be tried for 1 day on conduct that did not violate a law.\nI -- I--\n--Well, it's different, Your Honor.\nIn all of those cases, there was a law, at least giving the court jurisdiction, that was violated.\nThere's a very serious question here whether there was jurisdiction when they came in.\nJurisdiction is derived solely through statutes that are violated in the criminal field.\nThere were no statutes.\nSo there's a serious question of whether there was even jurisdiction.\nBut -- but what's different is it seems to me if you have a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort of a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or whatever other arguments you're going to make, that's -- that's light years away from a situation where there's absolutely no law to -- to violate.\nAnd the conduct--\n--I beg your pardon.\nBut, Your Honor--\n--But, Your Honor, I -- I -- in all due respect, I invite your attention to your case in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they have said that we have extended ex post facto to obviously a -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicial precedent and -- and the actions of prosecutors and what not.\nThis, I can't imagine in a way in terms of the concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of conduct that is not in violation of any law, that certainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex post facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if you want to go back to our very basics, and that's what unique about this case, the entitlement to notice of what conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you what conduct you have to avoid, and all those--\n--Beg your pardon, Your Honor.\nM-A-R-K-S.\nThat's in -- in our--\n--I -- I believe it was cited in our brief, Your Honor.\nI will give you that in just a moment, if I may.\nBut -- but I'm under the impression, Your Honor, from our research that there were a number of cases--\n--I think this comment is relevant to what you just said.\nOur forefathers in -- in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the few that they imposed on the States as well as the Federal Government, and I think that lends it force in a sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as does the Federal Government.\nBut we feel, under all those circumstances here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we certainly think a structural error, structural error in the sense that it ran from the beginning of the case.\nThe grand jury should not have indicted on conduct that violated no law.\nHe should not have been arraigned.\nHe should not have been tried.\nHe should not have convicted.\nHe should not have been considered.\nAll of this--\n--I -- I understand that, and I think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor.\nI find much of the evidence in this case extremely distasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws and Constitution.\nAnd it seems to me his rights are as important -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as any other person's.\nAnd the truth of the matter is that much of this very unattractive evidence came in before the law was ever enacted.\nAnd I think what happens is -- and this is a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it all comes together.\nAnd without any kind of instruction.\nI -- my view would be, under ex post facto principles, it would have ordinarily been excluded.\nIt wouldn't have been brought in.\nIn all due--\n--In all due respect, Your Honor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases have held that the ex post facto law has been extended to judicial precedent.\nAnd we cite those cases, Your Honor, in our brief.\nI think you're right, Your Honor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being applied through the Due Process Clause.\nBut the impact and the force of that, I think, is still just as great and just as powerful.\nAnd -- and -- and the error here factually is -- is absolutely enormous.\nAnd -- and what I think the very least a defendant in his position is entitled to is -- he's suffering under a 9-year sentence.\nI think he is entitled to have another trial where he is only confronted with the evidence that came after the statute.\nAnd if they're going to put in evidence that goes before that, they would have to justify that under one of a number of different concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others.\nAnd we would argue in that context -- none of this was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too extensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value.\nAnd I think that many judges would be sympathetic to that, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct.\nSome might come in--\n--And the only thing that I would think of immediately of that is, is the statute here.\nHe was -- there's no question the -- the -- the conduct was forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was applied in advance of those statutes, before--\n--I don't have a quarrel with you on that.\nYour Honor, I'm endeavoring to pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully.\nThis is not an evidentiary error.\nIt is in every sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is through the Due Process Clause.\nI think that there we meet on common ground.\nIt's through the Due Process Clause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made effective in trial.\nBut the truth of the matter is -- I mean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged these crimes going all the way back to January of 1999, when the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective until October of 2000.\nIf all the conduct that was proven at the--\n--I -- I think it would--\n--Yes, that's right.\nAnd I -- all I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from, it shouldn't be admitted except under one of the very narrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b).\nAnd we would argue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the evidence came from.\nAnd a judge would -- as I understand it, a judge would instruct the jury: You cannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence whatsoever that is pre-enactment.\nI think the possibility standard only applies to ex post facto statute cases and pre-enactment conduct.\nThat's my view, Your Honor.\nI think it's a very narrow holding.\nAnd I'm not urging that this would be the standard for other -- other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this would be the standard in ex post facto cases where -- what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule.\nWhat has gone on in the past is we have to measure.\nWe have to take, on the one hand, the post -- enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I -- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in that context whether a person got able representation until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.\nAren't we in the same position here?\nWouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on that, there will be a new trial?\nIt seems that's going to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and perennial -- perennial appellate review.\nThat's what I think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's decision.\nI think that's where there is a great deal of sense behind it.\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\nYes, absolutely.\nAnd this doesn't affect that whatsoever.\nI mean, I think there's a misconception among some people.\nWe -- the Second Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied them, one, two, three, four.\nThey didn't touch them.\nThey didn't in any way alter them.\nWhat they did is, on the concept and the rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't apply to plain error.\nThose four prongs have been left intact.\nAnd so they haven't disturbed that in any way whatsoever.\nThey set those four prongs out in the preamble of their opinion.\nObviously, what they found was, when you have a case of this magnitude of pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the trial and the judicial reputation.\nI say it myself.\nIt appeared on the front page of The New York Times: Man convicted for 2 years of conduct where there was no law.\nThat, I would guess, would have an adverse effect on the reputation of our judicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held this man should go back and get a new trial on the conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of the courts.\nSo applying that factor, we feel strongly and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nAnd we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct that violated the statute.\nIf you have no other questions, I -- I thank you for your attention.",
    "18": "Counsel, there was no limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given the opportunity to be copyrighted.\nIsn't that a substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're trying to proffer?\nYou're -- the hypothetical -- and I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to -- is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress wants to revive it.\nIsn't that different from not having had the opportunity at all, and being given a term to exploit your work and protect it?\nThe problem--\n--I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.\nIn 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights.\nThere were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works.\nOnce a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law.\nThat was true of most States.\nAnd some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States.\nSo it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law.\nSo what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain?\nRead those words to me?\nYou have to have a--\n--Your reading of that passage is different than mine.\nI think it's a -- it's saying whether you have or you haven't.\nIf we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail?\nIf the historical work does not point to what you claim?\nIn 1790.\nIf Congress did what I believe it did, would your argument fail?\n--it started in the place you want Congress to have started now.\nIt said, moving forward, there is a Federal copyright.\nIt didn't have to take things out of the public domain.\nWe are arguing about whether they did or didn't.\nBut assuming they did.\nYou don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here, and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected?\nAnd it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments?\nWhy not?\nForeign authors who decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be induced to think about coming into this market because now they can protect their works?\nYou're -- you're not answering my question.\nYou don't think that this law induces those foreign authors to come here and promote their work?\nCounsel, it might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here.\nThose are two different incentives.\nWhether -- you know, he could go anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the trip or get on the internet and find it.\nHe could do that now.\nCopyrighted materials here go at a different price than they do elsewhere.\nThat's not the issue.\nThe issue is the author's incentive.\nWell, if you can't incentivize them, they are not going to claim their rights.\nThey are not going to come and claim their rights.\nPart of this law is that they have to declare that they are interested in protecting their copyright here.\nOptional for them; but if they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.\nWhat's the limit that you're referring to?\nYou said there are limits.\nWhat--\n--Marbury -- the Davis law was passed.\nHad to go and pick out all the books it had that were subject to copyright and throw them out, or do what with them?\nStop them from circulation?\nI'm not sure -- how would they protect themselves from infringement?",
    "19": "Mr. Justice Burger, may it please the Court.\nAt the outset, I would like to emphasize that the propriety of the injunction against appellees Finley and Elrod, and the class of County Court clerks and sheriffs that they represent has not properly been presented to this Court for review.\nAppellees Finley and Elrod did not file any jurisdictional statement raising any questions for review.\nThe jurisdictional statement of the appellants did not challenge the class nor did it challenge the propriety of the injunction against defendant classes of clerks and sheriffs.\nIt merely raised the question of the propriety of the injunction against the appellees--the appellants proceeding against the appellees in the State Court.\nAppellees submit that in light of this fact, the injunction against the class of County Court clerks and sheriffs cannot be vacated on the appeal of the appellants since that issue has not been properly presented to this Court for review.\nThus, --\nUnder the rules of this Court, he is not an appellant.\nIn fact, their brief is submitted as appellees in support of the appellants position.\nThey did not--\nYes.\nBut I believe that was mistaken of -- it says jurisdictional statement for appellants Trainor and OMalley and this Court was docketed as case of Trainor versus Hernandez.\nTrainor and OMalley.\n10-1 states, I believe its 10-1, states that \u201call parties in the proceeding below shall be parties in this Supreme Court.\u201d\nHowever, --\nPrecisely.\nHowever, the jurisdictional statement of the appellants does not raise the propriety of the injunction against the appellees, the clerks and the sheriffs throughout Illinois.\nTherefore, this injunction cannot be challenged on appeal and that injunction must remain in full force and effect regardless of how the Court rules on the appeal of the appellants Trainor and OMalley.\nYes.\nYes, Your Honor.\nI believe that the Younger and Huffman under those cases, you have to look at the facts of each case and there may also be particular circumstances regarding each party.\nNow in this particular case, eventhough I submit it, its not really before the Court, there is different circumstances.\nFinley and Elrod were not parties to the State Court proceedings.\nThats right, Your Honor.\nThey are representatives of the class.\nI dont believe that the Court could even--\nWe asked for the class and --\nNo, Your Honor.\nWe like it very much.\nYour Honor, the class--\nYes, appellees Finley and Elrod.\nNo.\nAs appellees only.\nThe appellants are Trainor and OMalley who were the Attachment Creditors in the State Court proceeding.\nAppellants Trainor and OMalley, the Attachment Creditors.\nThats right.\nAll the other named parties and the class parties.\nIn light of this fact alone, we submit that either the appellant's appeal must be dismissed or the judgment affirms, and theres absolutely no effective relief that the Court can give the appellants.\nIf the injunction remains in effect, no creditors, including the appellants can obtain prejudgment that had been sought in Illinois.\nNow, the appellants have emphasized the fact --\nWe are here because the appellants filed a jurisdictional statement and this Court knows, there's probable jurisdiction.\nHowever, I submit that the issues raised in their appeal do not allow the Court to vacate the injunction against appellees, class representatives who have not appealed.\nWe raised that point.\nFirst of all, we raised it in a motion to dismiss and second, we raised it as point one in our brief.\nYes, we initially moved to dismiss this entire appeal.\nHowever, the Court had noted probable --\nThat would be in our motion to dismiss the appellants--\nIt is not is--well, there are two places where that would be found.\nOne would be in our motion to dismiss the appeal and the other point would be in our brief--argument one of our brief at page 15.\nThe appellants have claimed that they are state officials and that they were carrying out specific state function here and therefore the injunction against them was improper.\nAnd they point to the case of Huffman versus Pursue.\nThat case however is totally an opposite to the present case.\nIn that case, state officials were bringing a quasi-criminal action pursuant to a specific statute which gave those officials the exclusive right to bring that action.\nIn the instant case, the appellants utilized a general creditors remedy which can be utilized by any creditor in the State of Illinois and as the District Court noted it was mere happen stance, the creditor in this case happen to be in the State.\nFurthermore, the District Court did not enjoin appellants from proceeding against appellees in the State Court on their claim against the appellees.\nIn spite of the District Courts injunction against the prejudgment seizure of property under the Illinois Attachment Act.\nThe appellants were always free to proceed against the appellees in the State Court on their money claim.\nHowever, it should be pointed out that the appellants voluntarily chose to dismiss those proceedings.\nThey state those proceedings and ultimately dismissed those proceedings although nothing in the Federal Court injunction required them to do so.\nThus, any claim of interference with their attempts to sue the appellees simply cannot be taken seriously.\nYour Honor, theres no evidence in the record of that.\nAs a matter of fact --\nI believe, its their burden.\nThey are the appellants.\nWell, I believe we sustain that burden in the District Court.\nWhile the District Court proceedings were pending, the appellant stayed those State Court proceedings.\nOnce the Federal District Court enjoined the attachment, enjoined the appellees from proceeding to utilize the attachment act any further.\nThe appellants dismissed their case on the merits against the appellees.\nTherefore, any claim that they make that the Federal District Court interfered with their attempts to sue the appellees in the State Court or to interfere with the litigation at all in the State Court simply doesnt have any merit because they just dismissed that suit sue sponte.\nThats correct, Your Honor.\nHowever, the appellees were working.\nThey could certainly, if they could have possibly obtained a judgment here and I dont think that the record shows that they could have.\nBut have they obtained a judgment, they could have utilized a whole variety of post judgment procedures to execute upon their judgment.\nThere are number of reasons Mr. Justice White why we went to the Federal Court.\nFirst of all, we were raising a constitutional claim and --\nYes, Your Honor.\nHowever, this was a Federal claim under 1983 for an injunction against State officials charge with the execution of the act.\nNot in a timely manner.\nFirst of all, it has to be emphasized that whenever the issue is raised in the State Court, its always after the injury has occurred.\nThe property is seized without as we allege Due process of law.\nWe could have tried, Your Honor but there is--\nThere is no expressed provision in the Act.\nWe couldve attempted to do so.\nThere is no precedent which would allow us to have done that.\nWe could put it--\nNo, there is a number of ways.\nOne is putting up a bond; the other is by answering the affidavit on the merits that is denying the grounds.\nThats right.\nAnd then ultimately, there will be a trial in that issue.\nIf you win on the merits of the attachments.\nI'm sorry.\nThats right.\nAt the hearing of the attachment.\nIf the creditor files an affidavit, they Act provides that the debtor may file a counter affidavit.\nAnd that there will be a hearing on the factual issue as to whether or not an attachment was justified.\nThere is no provision in the Act for moving for any other type of hearing.\nWe could have filed a separate suit in State Courts.\nYes.\nI think we could have filed the separate suit in State Court.\nExactly.\nHowever, I dont--\nExactly.\nHowever, I dont believe that Younger versus Harris requires an exhaustion of all state remedies.\nYes, sir.\nWell, the law in Illinois is unsettled on that.\nAnd the question is to whether you can get class, plaintiff class and the defendant class relief.\nWe might have gotten an injunction in this instant case.\nNo.\nThe answer is no.\nThe answer is no, Your Honor\nThats right.\nWe could have gone into State Court in a separate proceeding and file the 1983 Act.\nAppellees submit that three decisions of these Court are clear authority for affirming the District Courts decision to proceed to the merits of this case.\nThose decisions are Lynch versus Household Finance, Fuentes versus Shevin, and Gerstein versus Pugh.\nLynch and Fuentes concerned summary credit or remedies almost identical to the Illinois Attachment Act under review.\nThat the Lynch case concerned prejudgment garnishment and in effect this case is a garnishment, since the property was held in the hands of a third party.\nAnd I might add, that Lynch was also a garnishment of a credit in to that account.\nIn Lynch and in Fuentes, the Court found the proceeding the prejudgment seizure not to be a proceeding in State Court.\nIn Lynch, the Court considered the question of applicability of the Injunction Act and in Fuentes the Court directly considered the question as to whether Younger was a part to this proceeding.\nAnd Id like to quote from Fuentes because I believe this quote is directly\u2014\nIn Fuentes, there would have been an eventual hearing on the--\nWell, the difference -- yes, under Section 26, we could have.\nYes, under Section 26 we could have.\nHowever, the statute does not provide for an immediate post seizure hearing.\nIt says, \u201cYou can answer the affidavit by filing a counter affidavit and there shall be a trial there on.\u201d\nBut you see an attachment is different from the replevin where the under -- in a replevin the question of possession of pendente lite is almost identical to the question of ultimate right to possession.\nWell, the way the procedure works is this.\nThe Writ of Attachment which is served upon the debtor indicates at the bottom that hearings on attachment will be disposed on the return date.\nAfter the date of the writ.\nIn this instant case, we did appear on the return date and we asked for a hearing and we were denied a hearing and we were told that these cases are routinely heard 30 days later.\nSo, there could be a 90-day period before you have the opportunity for that hearing.\nThe delay is possible under the statute.\nTheres no right to move for an earlier hearing.\nSo, that the statute is unconstitutional on its face since there was possibility for a delay of that long or greater.\nThe Act doesnt even say you have to have a hearing under return date.\nThe Act just says, there shall be a trial thereon.\nWell, this has to be seen in terms of the Mitchell decision where the Court found that one of the saving aspects of the Louisiana prejudgment sequestration statute, was that there was an expressed provision for an immediate post seizure hearing.\nAnd what we are saying is the Illinois Attachment Act does not have an expression for its provision for an immediate post seizure.\nEventually, as in Fuentes.\nIt is not about a motion to quash would be for a defect in the writ.\nIf it wasnt properly pleaded under the Act\nAnd the creditor--the creditor can amend the writ and continue the attachment.\nThe hearing is provided for only in Section 26 which says, \u201cEventually, you are entitled to a trial on the attachment issue.\u201d\nIt doesnt say when.\nThats right.\nThats correct.\nIts up to the discretion of the Court and I would add, anytime that the debtor comes in and asks for earlier hearing, the creditor could have got to that on the grounds that hes not prepared and he would ordinarily have the right at that later hearing.\nI believe that was December 3, 1974.\nWell, we get -- first of all, we got the District Court decision a year later.\nWere talking now about an appeal to this Court which has taken further time.\nFirst of all, Your Honor.\nWell, we got relief in the District Court.\nWe moved for a temporary retraining order and that was not decided but it was settled so that we did get half of the funds.\nThe Due Process issue was briefed and we wouldve gotten the decision in June but during this time, the Huffman decision came down and we are asked to re-brief that issue.\nNow, that is only something that would happen once if this Court would resolve that issue in our favor, that issue would not come up again.\nI think that would be rewriting the statute, Your Honor.\nI think that the--\nWell, that has to be read in pari materia with the return date provision.\nThat the return date can be set anywhere from 10 to 60 days.\nAnd the common understanding of the return date is when--\nThats right.\nAnd Id like to add too on this point that these procedural protections have to be seen working together, not separately.\nA major defect in this case as we have pointed out is the lack of the requirement to plead facts in the affidavit which would support the grounds for the attachment and the requirement of having to be up here before a judge to establish with these factual grounds indeed.\nSo, even if there were an eventual hearing, even if the right to a move for a hearing, the initial seizure does not have adequate safeguards to protect the debtor from a constitutional deprivation of his property.\nOn that point of the wrongful--possibility of a wrongful deprivation, I would like to turn to a point raised by the appellants that is that they had a meritorious claim here and that they were justified in the attachment.\nNow, it is not the role of this Court to determine that issue.\nI think that an examination of what really happened points out the great possibility in this case of a wrongful attachment.\nThe affidavit--the papers filed by the appellants in the Federal District Court--\nYes, sir.\nThe merits of the State Court plan.\nCertainly, and we were well prepared to litigate that in the State Courts and nothing in the Federal District Court injunction prevented any of the parties from litigating that in the State Courts.\nNow, the affidavits that the appellants have referred to actually established that there was no grounds for fraud.\nUnfortunately, in their printing of the appendix the affidavit which appears on page 52, there is an insert, an attachment, regarding how much money was in the account at the time the alleged fraud took place.\nThat does appear in the record at item 5.\nNow, their affidavit in the case of Mr. Hernandez applied for public assistance, March 24, 1972.\nThe itemized statement of his account indicates that on that date he had $55.00 in his credit union account.\nNow under Illinois Law, fraud cannot be alleged in a conclusory fashion, except in the Illinois Attachment Act.\nWhen you file a compliant for fraud, you have to allege specific factual allegations.\nYou have to allege misrepresentation of a specific fact, scienter intent to deceive, materiality of the allegation, reliance and damages.\nIf the attachment creditor had been required to allege those specific facts and to present that to a judge or any other officer who knows what the law is in Illinois, this attachment would never have been issued because a person who applies for public aid can have more than $55.00 in assets at the time he applies.\nSo that, if they had alleged the specific allegation that he said he didnt have anything and he really has $55.00.\nThey couldnt allege materiality because he would have gotten the money anyway.\nThe record also shows that Mrs. Hernandez didnt even have a credit union account at that time and furthermore that she wasnt the person who applied to public aid.\nTherefore, she made no misrepresentations.\nSo therefore, if the specific facts would have had been plead in the State Court to a judge based on their own evidence in the record there wouldnt have been an attachment.\nYet, because of the fact that you cannot get an attachment by filing an affidavit with conclusory allegation of fraud presented to a Court clerk, who really stamps that affidavit and sends summarily onto the sheriff, they were able to deprive these persons and all other persons--and all other creditors are able to deprive all of the persons similarly situated of their property without due process of law.\nYes, Your Honor.\nIt is.\nThe statements where made in our allegations in the compliant which were not denied.\nThere was no testimony.\nThis was all handled on affidavits and quash--\nNo.\nI dont believe theres any dispute as to that fact.\nI believe that all attorneys who practice in Illinois--\nWe allege that in our compliant that it was not denied.\nOnly in tort cases and thats --\nYes.\nOnly in tort cases and thats --\nIn contract cases thats presented to a Court Clerk in --\nI believe were both making the same allegation here.\nWe agree on this.\nSummary judgment.\nThats right.\nThats correct, Your Honor.\nThat is correct under the statutes.\nThats true.\nNo, we havent.\nFirst of all, the problem is with the State and in order to sue the State, you would have to go onto the Court of claims and its a very difficult procedure with no right of appeal and the initial problem we confronted was the constitutional problem for the appellees and the members of the class.\nSo therefore, we try to get that resolved first.\nThere is a damage claim pending in the Federal Courts right now under this 1983 action.\nAnd that will be reconsidered, and we intend to pursue that.\nThats right.\nYes, sir.\nThe Federal Court sued this case.\nCross motion.\nMotion to dismiss and a cross motion for summary judgment.\nThats correct.\nNow, Id like to go back to the Huffman issue and point out that Gerstein versus Pugh case I believe, disposes off this issue in our favor.\nThat in that case, unanimous Court concluded that Younger versus Harris was not a bar to a federal injunction against pretrial detention of arrestees charged by a prosecutor on information without a preliminary hearing.\nI would like to quote briefly from that statute because it bears directly on this case.\nThe Court noted the injunction was not directed at the state prosecution as such but only at the legality of pretrial detention without a judicial hearing -- an issue that could not be raised in defense of the criminal prosecution.\nThe order to hold preliminary hearings could not prejudice the conduct of the trial on the merits.\nIn this case, District Court injunction was not directed at the State Court proceedings as such.\nThat is at the merits of the underlying claim. But only at the legality of pretrial detention of the property which had been carried out without Due Process of law.T\nhat issue could not be raised as a defense to the main claim of the creditor.\nAnd finally and most importantly, for purposes of Younger, the resolution of the constitutional issue in the Federal Court did not prejudice in any way, the litigation of the conduct of the merits in the State Court.\nI believe in light of the Gerstein case and the Fuentes and Lynch case which I mentioned previously that the District Courts decision to proceed to the merits of the constitutional claim and to enjoin the county officials from carrying out the provisions of the Illinois Attachment Act was clearly correct.\nTherefore, we respectfully ask this Court to affirm the judgment below.\nYes, Your Honor.\nYes.\nParties must properly appeal.\nThats correct, Your Honor.\nAgainst them but not against the other parties.\nI believe the only decision the Court could reach is that the District Court should not have reached the question of the injunction against the appellants.\nThere may have been other considerations and as I submit there were.\nI believe that under Younger, one can consider the various circumstances concerning each one of the appellants or each one of the defendants in Federal Court and since the sheriffs and clerks were not parties to the State Court proceedings, there would be different considerations going to whether or not the injunction against them was proper.\nWell, I believe the appellant couldve rectified that problem by number one, appealing a class so that it would have been-- the issue would have been limited to \u2013 had they succeeded in overturning the class then the sole question would be the injunction against them in favor of this particular plaintiff.\nAnd I believe they could have presented to this Court the precise issue of whether or not the injunction was proper against the appellants.\nAbsolutely Your Honor.\nIts not a matter that needs to be straightened out by the District Court.\nIts a matter that the party should have straightened out before the appeal.\nFinley and Elrod filed an appearance when they were first served.\nThis was before the class was certified.\nRight.\nWe then move for certification of the classes.\nThe appellants Trainor and OMalley filed a memorandum in opposition to the class to the certification of the plaintiff class.\nThey never even raised the question of the defendant class.\nNo, this is a 23B-2 Class.\nSo, I believe under the federal rules theres no necessity\u2014\nThe record does not show that.\nHowever, it is my understanding that after the judgment was issued, notices were sent out to the various sheriffs and clerks informing--\nThis was an agreement between the parties.\nThank you.",

    "21": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.\nPlaintiffs appellants are black school-age children residing in Tunica County, Mississippi.\nThey filed this lawsuit in October of 1970 and they alleged and subsequently proved that they are attending public schools in Mississippi which were under Court order to desegregate under Alexander and under Green and that despite injunctive orders of the Northern District of Mississippi, the schools remained segregated.\nThey alleged further that the school -- their schools are segregated because there exists the Tunica County Institute of Learning which is a private segregated and segregationist academy located in Tunica County.\nThey alleged further and proved that this segregated Tunica Institute of Learning was under the laws of the State of Mississippi receiving free textbooks.\nAnd that this textbook aid to the Private Academy of Tunica County represented unlawful support of racial discrimination and assisted in undermining public school desegregation.\nThey challenged the constitutionality of the Mississippi statute which required the distribution of such textbooks to the private academies of Mississippi.\nEssentially, our complaint is that the State has a duty to avoid aligning itself with racial discrimination.\n1942, Your Honor.\nNo, Your Honor, it has not.\nIt was enacted in 1942 and amended insignificantly several times.\nIn 1942, the statute provided aid to elementary school pupils only and subsequently, the statute was extended to provide a textbook aid to high school students.\nI believe two years later, Your Honor.\nYes, sir.\nThere have been amendments, Your Honor, but our research indicates that theyre not significant amendments.\nTheyre amendments dealing with the administration of the statute.\nHowever, along that line, there was a significant change in regulations promulgated in 1970.\nAs pointed out in the Governments brief amicus curiae, the textbook purchasing board in 1970 in effect, adopted a regulation which made it possible for private segregated academies of Mississippi to receive textbooks directly from the State agency.\nPrior to 1970, a private academy depended upon a local school district to receive textbooks and under the Emergency School Assistance Act, such public school districts would lose federal money as they continue to provide textbooks to private academies and as a result, the State agency adopted a regulation which permitted, which indeed required that the private academies deal directly with the State textbook agency.\nYes sir.\nThis is a class action and --\n-- as a result the perspective of private schools or a perspective of the present state of public and private education in Mississippi is relevant.\nThere is no controversy on this basic point, Your Honors.\nThere exists in the State of Mississippi a network of private racially segregated academies.\nThey operate throughout the State of Mississippi and this system was formed with the purpose and has had the effect of one; undermining public school desegregation; and two, providing white students with an alternative to public school desegregation.\nAll of the academies are racially segregated.\nAll were formed concurrently with the implementation of freedom of choice plans or the implementation of Green or Alexander, decisions of this Court requiring immediate attainment of unitary school systems.\nAll were formed haphazardly without significant planning or resources.\nI shouldnt say all on that.\nPerhaps one or two were formed on the basis of considerable planning, but the overwhelming majority of these academies were formed haphazardly without planning, without significant resources.\nAll of the teachers and students in attendance of these private academies formerly attended or taught in the public school system located adjacent to or in the same vicinity as the private academy.\nWith few exceptions, these academies are all part of a new association called in Mississippi, The Private School Association and with very few exceptions, all are members of a Private Academy Athletic Conference.\nTheyre segregated.\nThey were formed in response to public school desegregation.\nThey undermine public integrated education.\nNo, Your Honor.\nWe can only speculate as to what would occur if this textbook aid were withdrawn.\nWe know it couldnt help the private academies.\nWe know it would be denying them in excess of a half a million dollars in basic inventories and it would be denying them the resources of the State but --\nIt amounts to six dollars per pupil, Your Honor.\nIt amounts to $5000 or $6000 per school.\nYes.\nYour Honor, given the finding effect in all of these cases, all of the cases involved in private academies that -- they were formed on the finished financial basis.\nGiven the widespread poverty in the State of Mississippi, its not beyond possibility that they will return to public schools if this aid and other aid is withdrawn.\nAgain, its speculative.\nWe have to concede that tuition grants, the withdrawal of tuition grants like the Coffey versus State Educational Finance Commission did not result in the return of white students to public integrated schools.\nYour Honor there is presently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi a suit to prohibit the States -- the State public schools of higher education from permitting the private academies the use of the athletic stadiums of our public colleges and universities.\nThere is of course the availability of various state educational agencies and programs which can be used in the State, in private academies of the State.\nBasically, however, the textbook aid is the outstanding major provision of aid to the private academies by the State of Mississippi at this time.\nYes sir or the schools would have to purchase them.\nWell, Your Honor, if the case is viewed as the provision of six dollars of aid per pupil, it might appear to be de minimis, but since this is a challenge to the provision of State aid, the question is not how much is each child receiving, but how much is the State of Mississippi allocating and distributing to the private schools of the State and it's distributing in excess of a half a million dollars of State money.\nWell, we dont know that thats relevant in the Fourteenth Amendment context.\nIts clear that the books are being selected by the school.\nTheyre being stocked by the schools.\nNow, theoretically, the aid is going to the student, but practically speaking, the schools are controlling the program.\nYes, indeed we do, Your Honor and thats one of the issues raised by this appeal.\nWhether the standard for reviewing state support of parochial schools is comparable to the standard for reviewing state support of racially segregated schools and we submit, of course, that the two amendments are substantially different and we can get to that immediately.\nThe Chief Justice in Walz versus Tax Commission and I quote stated that, \u201can effort to interpret and understand the establishment or religion clauses of the First Amendment requires that we apply constitutional principles so as to serve,\u201d and I quote, \u201cultimate constitutional objectives as illuminated by history.\u201d\nIn Walz versus Tax Commission, the Court went on to quote Mr. Justice Douglas and said, \u201cWhen the state encourages religious instruction, it follows the best of our traditions or then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.\u201d\nIn other words, under the First Amendment when we look at the history of the religion clauses, we find that their objective was not to eliminate any form of State aid for religious instruction.\nInstead, we find an internal tension or instead as the Court has observed, we walk a tight rope and we balance the establishment clause against the free exercise clause.\nRecognize that in terms of our history, religion has served an important function and in terms of the religion clauses, we must strike the balance and protect the individual in his right, his First Amendment right to pursue his religious beliefs.\nWhen we turn to the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor, we find instead a history marked by a commitment to the elimination of State support for racial discrimination.\nThis is the fundamental difference between any approach to aid in the context of the religion clauses and aid in the context of equal protection.\nWe are as a people committed to recognizing the value of religion in American life.\nAt the same time, we are as a people and as a matter of constitutional principle, committed to the elimination of racial discrimination and the support of racial discrimination by the State.\nSo, it is of no help to us in this case to refer as the District Court did to our First Amendment standard.\nThere are again in the words of the Chief Justice, in the Walz versus Tax Commission, ultimate constitutional objective as illuminated by history in the First Amendment which are diametrically opposed to objective as illuminated by history in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe failure of the District Court to recognize this represents the basic fundamental error which we bring to this Court.\nAgain, along the same lines, we have since the enactment, the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn our very recent history have civil rights laws enacted by the Congress in 1957, in 1961, in 1964, in 1968 and 1965 and 1968.\nAll of these legislations, all of the decisions of the Court since Cooper versus Aaron, since Brown versus Board of Education stand for the proposition that the constitutional objective as illuminated by history in the Fourteenth Amendment context is the elimination of any state support for racial discrimination.\nWhen the State of Mississippi aligns itself by the provision of a half a million dollars to direct subsidy to private academies which discriminate on the basis of race, it has violated this historical -- the Fourteenth Amendment as illuminated by history.\nYour Honor, we dont believe that the absence of a specific purpose to discriminate in anomaly undermines our claim or in any way dilutes or attenuates the States duty not to align itself with public, with racial discrimination.\nIn fact, when the statute was passed, we had an absolute dual school system in Mississippi, so the issue could never have arisen in 1942.\nIf anything we know that the legislature of Mississippi in 1942 provided textbook aid for segregated academies or for segregated schools, at that time they were public.\nThis was reminiscent of the problem faced in Brown versus Board of Education where we had no legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment which revealed the intention of Congress with regard to public education.\nIn fact, there was no public education, said the Court in Brown, at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAnd given that fact, the Court had to move to other considerations to determine whether there was a violation of equal protection.\nSo, we have a statute passed in 1942 before the problem arose and the question of purpose cannot be pursued in the same way that we would pursue purpose with the specific facts available.\nIn addition to that, the Court --\nIn 1942, no sir.\nIn 19 -- well, in 1942, we had a dual school system which was lawful.\nIn 1972, we have a dual school system that is unlawful.\nNow, what is true, Your Honor, in terms of the statute and in terms of the black children of Mississippi and this reminiscent of a woman -- reminiscent of woman in power, It is of no consolation to the black children of Mississippi or the black population of Mississippi that the legislature in 1942 did not intend to promote segregation.\nThe fact is, the effect of the statute is to promote segregation and that promotion of segregation is the gravamen of our complaint.\nIt is of no consolation to the black children that the State does not intend to do something when the evil is there.\nNow, again on this First Amendment or this religion issue versus the Fourteenth Amendment issue, in Green versus Kennedy, another three-judge District Court was faced with the problem of federal tax exemption benefits to the private academies of Mississippi, the same private academies.\nI remind the Court that a tax exemption was an indirect benefit to these private academies, there was significantly less support for racial discrimination in Mississippis textbook statute.\nHere we have a direct grant of at least a half a million dollars, or a quarter of a million dollars annually and yet, the three judge District Court affirmed by this Court held that tax exemption is only minimal and remote involvement when compared to the kind of identification in support of religion prohibited by the establishment clause.\nBut the governmental and constitutional interest of avoiding racial discrimination in educational institutions embraces the interest to be -- or precludes even indirect economic benefit to racial discrimination.\nAgain, its juxtaposition of the requirements of the religion clauses versus the requirement of the equal protection clause.\nWe are of the clear view that the proper standard for reviewing State support for racially discriminatory educational institutions can be found in Cooper versus Aaron.\nThere, this Court held that State support for racial discrimination through any arrangement, through any management or any fund is violative of equal protection.\nWhen the State of Mississippi provides textbook aid and places itself behind the racial discrimination, and in effect or in fact incurred this racial discrimination, it violates Cooper versus Aaron.\nAnd our second basic theory is that under the principles of Green versus New Kent County, Virginia, the State has an affirmative duty to promote racially integrated education, that given its support for racial discrimination in the dual school system in the past, it is duty bound today to remove itself entirely from racial discrimination.\nIndeed, it has a duty to quarantine racial discrimination.\nAnything less than that would be violative of Green versus New Kent County, Virginia.\nThats correct, Your Honor.\nYour Honor, we have conducted -- we -- extensive discovery in this case.\nWe have 104 deposition in -- depositions in evidence.\nWe believe that weve already made a record against all 148 academies.\nYes, Your Honor.\nIndeed we have and part of the --\nYes Your Honor.\nWell, that theyre segregate --\nWell, we have --\nYour Honor, some have -- some school administrators, private school administrators testified that they had an open enrollment policy.\nYes, Your Honor.\nTheyre a handful of such disputes.\nWell, we believe that the District Courts concerned and confronted with private academies in Mississippi have already held that all of these academies by segregationist institutions that question of fact.\nNo, Your Honor in -- well, by implication in this case, the extensive findings of fact were not made in this case, but in other cases, in Coffey I and Coffey II, in Green versus Kennedy.\nBy implication it did.\nIt found that they are racially segregated and it considered the issue before the Court as framed by the assumption that they were racially segregated and segregationists that is they had a closed admissions policy that blacks would be excluded.\nIt didnt make that specific finding.\nIt assumed it for the purpose of argument, they held --\nYour Honor, on remand, I believe the District Court could look at each school and find in the record sufficient evidence to show that they were segregationists.\nNow, this case involved the taking of numerous depositions of private school administrators who had an ample opportunity to intervene and protect their interests.\nNo such private academy intervened.\nWell, thats correct but at the same time, the evidence showed that they were formed at critical moments in critical school districts and that, they were in fact segregated schools.\nYour Honor, I believe, Ill give you the exact figure.\nAll students are white except for 15 Chinese.\nThis is what school officials said.\nThis appears at footnote 3 of appendix A of page 1A.\nAll students and all faculty members are white except for 15 Chinese, 16 Orientals, two Indians and two Latin Americans.\nThats out of a total of 42,000 children.\nTheres not a single black child in any of these academies.\nOne or two.\nNot prior to Brown.\nYes, one or two prior to Brown, Your Honor.\nYes.\nNow, they couldve been founded prior to Brown and after Green and Alexander expanded their program to accommodate whites who were plain public integrated schools and to the extent that they opened their doors, added facilities, added grades, they would be demonstrating that theyre segregationist and undermining public integrated education and should therefore be subject to an injunctive order prohibiting textbook aid to them.\nYes, Your Honor, thats certainly possible.\nAgain, were not claiming that all private schools should not receive textbooks.\nOur claim is that a specific type of private academy should not be receiving that.\nIts a private school formed for the purpose or having the effect of providing white students with an alternative to public integrated education.\nNo, sir.\nNot necessarily.\nIt would be true of virtually every private school in the State of Mississippi, but Im referring to the questions raised by Mr. Justice Powell about the East Coast of the United States.\nThey wouldnt be covered, Your Honor.\nYou see, the academy Im speaking of had substantially expanded its enrollment at key moments and these are -- in other words, an academy formed in 1945 which enrolled 200 pupils and served grades one through four, through the year 1968, Green.\nAnd then in 1968, expanded its enrollment to 1000 white students and served grades one through 12 would be a school which was undermining public integrated education.\nWell, Im talking about an effect principle which Im prepared to limit to a formal -- formally de jure school system or State which operated a de jure system of public school, de jure segregated system of public education which subsequently -- subsequent to the integral -- substantial integration of schools experienced a loss, a substantial loss of white pupils who are presently attending the segregated academy.\nYour Honor, we would submit that in the State of Mississippi, an open admissions policy would return the State to freedom of choice.\nThe classic example in the city of Jackson where we have lost 40,000, excuse me, 40% of the white students, we have white citizen's council schools assuming that the white citizens council adopted an open admissions policy and lets assume further that the very remote possibility that blacks would attend the white citizens council school came to pass, we would have the white citizens council still undermining public integrated education.\nNo, Your Honor.\nIm saying that if that what --\nIm saying that if they want to go to private schools, they ought to do so without States support.(Voice

    "22": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI'd like to take just a moment to explain what this case is about from the Chippewa's perspective, and then turn to the 1850 order and the equal footing issues.\nThis case involves core Indian interests.\nFor centuries, the Chippewa have hunted, fished, and gathered wild foods.\nThese activities still put food on their tables.\nThey help pay for life's necessities, and they are in a very real sense central to the culture and identity of the Chippewa.\nThat is correct, Your Honor, but they could not use fish and game in the way they use it in their culture.\nLet me give you two examples.\nOne of the most important fishing activities for the Chippewa is spring spear fishing.\nIt's something their ancestors have done for generations.\nThey still do today.\nIt is illegal under State law in both Wisconsin and Minnesota to spear fish in the spring.\nIn each of these reservation communities, there are families that are providers.\nYes, Your Honor.\nIn the springtime.\nAs the ice moves out on these northern lakes, they go out in canoes and they use spears and lights to take fish.\nYes.\nYes, there is, Your Honor.\nIt's a part of their traditions, and they spoke to it in testimony in this case.\nIt's--\n--It's more than that, Your Honor, and there was testimony in the trial about the importance of these activities to their culture and to their religion.\nThey have to sneak out... before these rights were reaffirmed by the courts, they would have to sneak out and try to do it without getting caught.\nThat was the only way they could do it.\nNot until this case was decided.\nThe other example I was going to give Your Honor was, in each of these communities there are people that are providers.\nThey go out and they get fish and game and they supply it to elders and others who are incapable of getting it themselves.\nState bag limits and State seasons prevent them from pursuing those activities, from providing fish and game at funerals which occur out of season, or for... as part of ceremonies in connection with births or other life cycle events that happen to take place in the wrong season.\nThey cannot preserve these traditions if they are subject to State law, and that's why we're here.\nTurning to the 1850 order, I wanted to provide our answer to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the Indians were told and what they understood at the time the 1850 order was issued.\nWhat the record shows is that they were told that the order was an order to remove.\nThey were not told that the order was an order to stop hunting and fishing, or would have any effect on hunting and fishing.\nThey were told they had to move.\nIn 1855--\n--There was evidence that a circular was prepared which had a copy of the order, and that was sent to the bands in Wisconsin, which were... who are the targets of the removal effort.\nIt was not sent, for example, to the Mille Lacs Band, which was never a target of the removal effort, but that's what... there was evidence to that effect.\nIn 1855, the Territorial Governor of Minnesota, who was the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, he was the highest Federal official responsible for implementing Federal Indian law in the Territory of Minnesota, wrote a letter and said that the Indians had no interest on these lands except hunting and fishing.\nHe specifically recognized, 5 years after this order was issued, that they had hunting and fishing rights under the 1837 treaty.\nThere was an incident up at Mille Lacs Lake.\nHe sent an investigator there, and the investigator reported that the lumbermen and all of the Chippewa believed that they still had hunting and fishing rights under the 1837 treaty.\nThis correspondence went--\n--We have--\n--two theories, Your Honor, first that it was null and void, it was invalid when it was issued, and second that it had been rejected as the policy of the United States, as the pleasure of the President, shortly after it was issued.\nThe order, the purpose of the order was to remove the Indians, and the order specifically says that they're ordered to remove.\nIn addition to revoking their rights, they're hereby ordered to remove.\nWell, the question then turns on whether you can sever the order.\nWell, you do.\nI mean, that's the issue, is should you.\nThat's the issue.\nYes.\nYes, Your Honor, but with the caveat that you would apply--\n--the rules you apply in Indian cases.\nWell, we look to whether the order would have been issued revoking the hunting and fishing rights in the absence of the removal directive, and all of the evidence was that it would not have been, that the only purpose of this order was to remove the Indians.\nSure.\nThe territorial legislature requested a removal order because they said the Indians were causing problems, and it doesn't make sense to say, all right, in response to that, we'll leave the Indians where they are, but tell them they can't hunt and fish any more.\nThat doesn't--\n--Sure, sure, and so unless you're removing them, the revocation of hunting and fishing doesn't serve any purpose.\nThe only purpose it serves is as part of a removal effort, and that effort is abandoned.\nWell, let me--\n--I think the Federal officials who were involved in preparing this order would have thought it illogical to order the Indians to remove at the same time they retained a treaty right to hunt and fish on the lands they were being removed from, that, if that wouldn't have made sense to say, you still have a treaty right to hunt and fish here, but you have to leave.\nRight.\nCan I address your point about during the pleasure, Your Honor?\nI'd like to talk about that, because the State's interpretation of the 1837 treaty and the President's authority under that treaty we think is really quite remarkable.\nUnder the State's interpretation, the President could revoke these rights at any time.\nHe could revoke them, according to the State, as part of an unauthorized removal attempt, which led to hundreds of Chippewa deaths.\nHe could revoke them at a time, as the district court found, when the land wasn't needed for settlement and there was no other interest of the United States served by the revocation.\nBut what he couldn't do, according to the State, is, upon learning of the consequences of the removal order, he couldn't allow the Indians to remain and to hunt and fish during his pleasure.\nIn other words, he couldn't do the one thing the treaty says he could do, and that doesn't make any sense.\nIt's up to the President.\nNo, because--\n--Well, I mean, there's a process in the Constitution for how that happens, and it says you have to be removed, and there's also a process for how Your Honors are appointed.\nIn this case we have a treaty that says there's a privilege, and all it says about the President is, it's guaranteed during the pleasure of the President, and it seems to me perfectly consistent with the language of the treaty to say the President can decide if he made a mistake, if he issued this order, and it turned out, as the record shows, to be a disaster, that it turned out, as the record shows, that there wasn't any need for it, to say, this was a mistake, they can stay, and during my pleasure they can hunt and fish.\nThe language of the treaty, the rule that if there are ambiguities they should be resolved in favor of the Indians, and the understanding of the Indians, as shown in the record of this case.\nYes, Your Honor, and it would not be the President's pleasure to end it unless he was displeased with the Indians.\nI think they understood that it was too soon in light of the circumstances that were present then.\nIf settlement had proceeded at a different pace, the answer might be different, but there were no demand for these lands at that time.\nBecause they didn't draft--\n--The answer is that they didn't draft... the Chippewa didn't draft the treaty.\nThey made X's, yes, Your Honor.\nWell, Your Honor, there were a lot of people there with their own interests.\nThe missionaries wrote, right after the treaty was signed, that they have no understanding of the duration of a man's pleasure.\nWhat they were told--\n--Well--\n--Well, what they were... the other thing they were told throughout this treaty council was that they would be treated justly by the President and that, of course, was a reflection of the provisions in the Northwest ordinance, the trust responsibility as articulated by this Court, and what we think that means in this context is there are some reasons the President could not act, and that was the case in 1850.",
    "23": "Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.\nFirst of all, I would like to point out in this particular case the petitioner Giacomo Reina had been convicted of the crime of conspiracy to violate the narcotic laws of the United States.\nHe has never been charged or convicted of the substantive crimes from which he has been convicted of conspiring to violate.\nI have distinguished the facts of this case in my brief.\nA question was asked yesterday by the Court as to what prejudice there would be to the petitioner in the event that this Court construed the purge clause of the judgment as running from the date of final determination by this Court of the matter now before the Court instead of following the plain language of the judgment which commenced the purge clause as of February 2nd in 1959 that this -- such a construction would create more problems than it could possibly solve.\nIt's apparent from the record of the Court and I refer the Court to page 25, 24 of the transcript of the record, the second paragraph down the second statement of Mr. Cobe who was the attorney for the petition at below.\nMr. Cobe stated toward the end of the first paragraph that the order which this petition has been held in contempt on the order of Judge Edelstein was construed by Judge Edelstein that the petitioner should answer all questions referred to one before the grand jury including those which might not appear on these papers, therefore, even assuming that this Court would construe the purge clause as commencing as of the date that this Court made a final determination such a construction might possibly preclude this petitioner down below if called before the grand jury again to attack the reasonableness or materiality of certain questions propounded to him.\nIn other words, it would put him on his own -- own peril that if he would challenge the materiality that he would not purge himself and that he would remain in prison and if any members of the Court raised the question that made -- that the Government might not digress from the purposes of the investigation, I refer the Court to page six of the record, the bottom questions propounded to Reina before the grand jury.\nI haven't raised this point on this petition but at the bottom, Mr. Reina was asked this question.\nMr. Reina, was your father Thomas a member of an organization sometimes known as the mafia.\nI can represent to this Court from my own personal knowledge that Mr. Reina's father died 30 years ago.\nReina was further asked that his father had a title Don in that organization, then he was asked after his father's death, did Reina take the place and title of Don in the organization and what are the names of the members of the organization?\nThis I respectfully submit has to the deal with matters that occurred 30 years ago and could have no possible reference to any narcotic investigation or narcotic matter now under investigation.\nI would like to refer this Court in the conclusion of my argument that Title 21 United States Code Section 198, which does not appear in my brief, this makes it a duty on the part of the Government to make narcotic information available to the State Governments the use in the state courts.\nI would also like to bring to the attention of the Court, I omitted this from my brief, I omitted the State of California.\nThe California Penal Code Section 1324, 1958 supplement by statute, and by statute the State of California has adopted the Michigan rule which disagrees with the Murdock decision.\nThank you.",
    "24": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.\nMy name is Stephen Tatem from El Paso, Texas and I represent the petitioner in this case that has been sued for violating United States Letters Patent entitled Dairy Establishment.\nThe patent was filed on November the 5th of 1963 and was finally issued on November the 14th of 1965.\nIt has been admitted in this case and so found by the Fifth Circuit that every element in this patent consisting of 13 elements is old in the art.\nIn a part of the Fifth Circuit opinion which has validated of this patent on the basis that it exhibits novelty and is not obvious, the court has specifically said that while this honorable court rejected its rationale Graham when it validated a patent on the basis that an old result in a cheaper and otherwise more advantageous way.\nAlthough the court rejected that proposition, the Fifth Circuit in this case confessed that it was ignorant as to what test, if any, this Court substituted or what had struck out.\nIt is submitted that this case is controlled and govern by the decisions in this case written by this Court in Anderson's-Black Rock, Graham versus John Deere, A. & P. and Lincoln Engineering.\nIt is our position that the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the trail court findings on three different occasions to the affect that this combination patent did not show novelty, none obviousness and that under Rule 52, they are supported by credible evidence, were not clearly erroneous and they were reached by proper application of the law to the facts.\nMr. Justice, it is my understanding and I confess that I am not a patent attorney.\nThis by chance is the first patent case that I have ever had the pleasure to be dealing with, but as I understand that law in this Court's enactment in the Graham case, while the three inquiries that are asked under Section 103 are considered factual inquiries, a final determination as to whether or not a patent is or is not valid is a question of law to which this Court and only this Court is the final arbiter.\nI'm also of the opinion that the question of novelty would be in that same category.\nWell, I believe that the validity of a patent is a question of law.\nIn making that determination whether it's the trial court or the Court of Appeals or in this Court of necessity in reaching the question of whether or not it is non-obvious, there are certain factual inquiries that lay the predicate as to whether or not the final decision in obvious, non-obviousness is one of law.\nI think that it is relevant in understanding what is involved in this particular patent, and the only \u2013 the only means that we are talking about in this particular patent that is allegedly new and outside the prior art is the means to house or hold water at upper end of a dairy barn in a pool or on the floor so that when it \u2013 so that it can be released suddenly to flow downhill and as it flows downhill, the natural propensity of water removes manure that is on or on deposit on a concrete floor.\nI think it is important for this Court to understand first, what are the basic features of what I refer to as standard grade \u201cA\u201d dairy barn floor plan and the reason for that is, is they are fairly standard.\nThey are regulated in order to be able to sell and produce grade \u201cA\u201d milk, you have to have certain sanitary conditions in order to be entitled to that type of production.\nFirst basic to a modern dairy is the fact that the floor is concrete, it is paved.\nIt generally slopes downhill towards a drain.\nThe reason for that is to allow or to assist water that is on the floor to be removed.\nThe floor itself is contoured or it is shaped to try to avoid puddles.\nThere are may or may not be groves in the concrete.\nThe groves would allow or assist water to remove manure that maybe deposited on the floor.\nWell, Mr. Kolisch has reproduced in a supplemental appendix beginning on page 11 his patent of the supplemental appendix which is this one.\nNow, the patent is also in evidence and is a part of the single volume appendix although I confess it is a little harder to read because it's small.\nYes.\nI would just refer you to the larger one because it's easier at page 11.\nWell, in all candor Mr. Justice, the two and a half minute movie was not in evidence.\nThere is a larger one \u2013 there is a larger movie.\nI think it was about 15 or 20 minutes.\nI think there may be one that is filed.\nThere may be one that is filled but \u2013-\nWell \u2013-\nThere was a movie in the record Your Honor, but that was the one it was introduced in the trial court before Judge Gwen in El Paso and it's about 15 or 20 minutes.\nAnd as I understand, the one that has been asked to be shown in argument is an edited movie not from the same one and we would object to that being shown because it's an attempt to supplement the record, or it is not the same movie that was in \u2013-\nI don't know that it is from the same movie Your Honor.\nWell --\nThat is true.\nYour Honor \u2013-\nNo, I don't want to disqualify any judge.\nI can't make a decision on that because I haven't seen the movie that you are thinking about.\nI don't want you to \u2013-\nIf it's not the same movie in evidence, that's right.\nBut I wouldn't say that the movie is going to disqualify judge that has looked at it.\nIf there is a movie \u2013 if the Court wants to see the one that it was in evidence is the 15 or 20 minute.\nI think it is.\nSo far as I understand it that it is.\nI was asked for -- specifically to have all of the exhibits from the Fifth Circuit up here and I was under the impression that was here --\nThat would be my position.\nNo sir, I was not at the Fifth Circuit.\nIt was my understanding as long as the matter has been raised that the movie that was offered to the Fifth Circuit was from the same movie.\nWe are not sure now.\nIt may be but I am saying that there has been some question raised about it and I am not in a position to say because I did not see the movie.\nAll right sir.\nAll right sir.\nI believe, I may be wrong, but I thought the Fifth Circuit had two movies there.\nI may be wrong but I thought all the exhibits were also before the Fifth Circuit.\nOn top of the floor are cow stalls, feeding area, milking area, and holding area and the cow of necessity needs to walk from various areas to the other -- on this concrete floor.\nAlso, in standard dairy barn is some type of trough or tank which holds the water.\nNow, I submit to the Court, that in the mid 1960s, when the application for this particular patent was submitted, and if we look at the definition of how Webster defines flush, to mean a sudden release or washout, sudden rapid flow of water to flood, it would be most difficult to come up with a new idea that added to the sum of useful knowledge with a \u201cflush system\u201d because by definition, we are dealing with water that must be suddenly released as a rapid rate of flow to wash out, to flow or to flood in order to have a flush system by definition.\nThe respondent's expert Mr. Hubert has given us a detailed explanation of how this flush concept works.\nIt's in the appendix beginning at page 114 through 116, but its basic concept is, that when water begins to flow it creates energy which serves as a cleaning action and that the natural propensity of water as it flows downhill is to have the bottom of the water on to the floor, the top surface of the water goes faster and therefore as the water flows downhill, it has a natural cleaning action.\nThe basic propensity of water is generally related to the amount of the water released and the slope or the grade of the floor onto which it is released.\nNow, when we get to this point in the record and it was in the record before it is in our briefs, we had cited this reference before, I think it is relevant to discuss this legend of Hercules.\nWhat did he do?\nIt is recorded, it is only a legend but it is recorded in Greek Mythology in that as Hercules as his fifth labor saw the conditions of stables, he at a single glance diverted the stream of Alpheus to clean the stables of the filthy manure on the floor.\nNo, sir, it is not.\nIt certainly does.\nI would cite the Court \u2013-\nWell, I would say until the time of the bucket, because it is submitted and again I have to be in all candor with the Court, it seems that this tank is simply the release of \u2013 we are talking about a tank that has 2000 gallons of water and releasing 2000 gallons of water of itself is going to bring about some action and we maintain that that is not a noble idea, it is not add to the some of the useful knowledge, but I do direct the Court's attention to some prior art that is recorded and that is set out in some detail beginning on page five of our reply brief.\nThe first of the patents is the McCornack patent which again it is much more legible that if it is looked in the blue appendix, it's much larger beginning on page 55.\nMcCornack patent by chance is named Dairy Plant.\nThe patent we are talking about is Dairy Establishment.\nThe patent to McCornack was issued on June 1st of 1937, but the McCornack patent deals with the idea of trying to save labor both as to the milking and removal of manure operation and for disposing of the manure or slurry as a natural fertilizer after the operation is complete.\nMcCornack teaches that and they also use the word flush specifically in the specifications that the milking benches and gutters are washed, the water flows from the shoals, flushes simultaneously by means of a common valve.\nMcCornack teaches that what happens is that the operator who was located near the rear of the cows steps on a foot pedal in the floor that releases the water against the shoals which flows downhill.\nI also cite the Court's attention to the patent of Bogert which begins on page five through seven of the reply brief.\nBogert specifically deals with an apparatus for cleaning the surfaces of barns.\nIts application for patent was issued on March the 4th of 1941.\nNow, in the Bogert, Bogert refers to \u201cA fluid cleaning medium\u201d which when you read the specifications is water.\nBogert refers to a \u201cfluid cleaning medium supply tank\u201d which is attached on the floor at the upper end of this particular barn, which when a \u2018cap valve' and I direct the Court's attention to the visualization of this, it's very similar to the top of commode seat, it's on page 75.\nThat is his basic layout but be that as it may, this for your will commode seat is picked up by chain which causes the water to be stored in this \u201cfluid cleaning medium supply tank\u201d to go downhill by gravity and then enter the various gutters.\nNow, I want to point out specifically that in Bogert, which is the March 4, 1941 patent, the cows were arranged so that the manure of necessity fell into a gutter.\nIt did not flow onto the floor.\nSo, therefore, the fluid from the fluid cleaning medium supply tank only flushed the gutter.\nThe patent in question \u2013 the cows \u2013 the manure is not necessarily deposited in such manner.\nIn other words it is not accumulated solely in a gutter.\nSo here's tank is water.\nI want to refer the Court specifically to the language of the patent office on page 13 through 15 of my brief.\nIn examining these prior art publications the patent office said this, since the patent in McCormick discloses that is old in the art to flush cattle stalls and to collect for fertilizer, it is held to be an obvious expedient under 35103 to provide the (Inaudible) Dairy Establishment with such a flushing means and waste collection tank.\nOn page --\nNo sir.\nMr. Chief Justice, that is what the Fifth Circuit said, the prior art that I am talking about is not what the Fifth Circuit was talking about.\nIt has been conceded by the respondent that it was identical to their pact but that we haven't -- I have not talked about Mission Dairy yet.\nMaybe it is necessary at this point in time if I may --\nAlright, what I simply wanted to do and it is my position that the record before that was made before Judge Gwen that went up to the Fifth Circuit with respect to the McCormick and Bogert Patents as well as the other evidence was sufficient for this Court to apply the four Supreme Court cases I have brought to the Court's attention.\nLet me bring up what happened procedurally.\nIn January of 1973, my client, who then was living in Florida, by chance was met Mr. Herbert Meyer who happen to be in Florida.\nAt that particular time in January of 1973 we had not received the decision, the second decision from the Fifth Circuit.\nIn February in 1973, the Fifth Circuit reversed for the second time this patent application, I mean this patent case.\nWe filed at that time when we had received notice at the second case had been reversed, a motion for re-hearing addressed to the Fifth Circuit raising the question that Mr. Sakraida had only three weeks before personally met the name of the man who owned the Mission Dairy in Gonzalez California.\nIt was it that time that the Fifth Circuit directed us since we were the appellee to bring this motion to the attention of the trial court because they were the only medium through which we could act to get a record, so we did that.\nWe filed a motion pursuant to the direction of the Fifth Circuit with the trial court in El Paso.\nThere was a different trial court that was sent from San Antonio, Texas to El Paso to receive the testimony with respect to Mr. Herbert Meyer, Mr. Bud Sakraida, Mr. Chester Whitmore, and Mr. Frank Susa.\nThose exhibits together with the pictures from Herbert Meyers Dairy are also before the Court as exhibits A through K. Following that hearing, Judge Wood, up until that time had nothing to do with this case, also entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nHe found that the patent lacked novelty.\nIt did not meet the test of obviousness.\nIt was anticipated by this prior art and that the petitioner had exercised due diligence in discovering the name of the witnesses because they arose simply out of a by chance meeting somewhere in the State of Florida in January of 1973.\nWell \u2013-\nWell, Mr. Chief Justice, Judge Wood's findings on that very point --\n-- before, he was the trial court that accumulated that record and attended that hearing, appear in the appendix first at page 174 through 175.\nSecond they appear at the appendix at page 268, but he is clear and he gave creeds to our testimony, that my light is on, do you want me to -- all right, he gave credence to our testimony that until this by chance meeting we never identified anything with respect Mission Dairy.\nWell -- but Mr. Chief Justice the name of Meyer is the link to Mission Dairy because until you find Mr. Meyer, you are not able to ascertain what it was that was in existence at Mission Dairy because Mr. Meyer held key to that.\nThe testimony in the record is essentially to this effect.\nBetween the date that the summary judgment was granted and the date of merits, my client was living in the state of Florida, the Mission Dairy is in the State of California, the trial was pending in El Paso, Texas.\nThrough rumors source unknown, the record is that Mr. Sakraida, it was through a rumor suggested, it was suggested the hand the he go the Mission Dairy and check out what it was that was there.\nSince he was living in the State Florida, he asked a man sold milking equipment, a man identified as Mr. Wisdom who was living in the State of Oregon, that the next time he was down in the area to go by the dairy and try to find out what was there.\nThe testimony is that when he went to the Mission Dairy, he received a rebuff by the manager, a Mr. Dick Ripley.\nHe was not, he got to the premises but he was not able to get in and supposedly find out about this flushing gate that they had.\nHe called client about the rebuff and we did not know anything more about it than what we've been informed about by Mr. Wisdom?\nThe name of Herbert Meyer is an assumption that the respondent will have us believe, was linked at the same time we went to Mission Dairy.\nThere's absolutely no evidence in the appendix as to where Herbert Meyer was when Mr. Wisdom was in California or that we knew Mr. Meyer's name and the trial court chose to believe us on those facts and that why that, findings to that effect is so clear with respect to that.\nMr. Justice Stevens the evidence with respect to Herbert Meyer is that in January of 1962 he had plans on file with California soil conservation service with respect to his idea.\nAs far as milking operation it's our position that the Mission Dairy though is clearly evidence of ordinary skill in the art and that was part of the basis what we were using it?\nWe do because I think you -- I don't think \u2013-\nThe fact that the idea was known and made public a year prior to the application of this patent and that is when you go down to the California soil conservation people or the department of the agriculture and file plans to get approval as to what you're going to build or do, that you have reduced in essence or have publicized.\nI'm saying he's publicizing his idea.\nObviously there's a time lapse between actually he filed a plan and when he actually got the -- you see the problem was not getting the dairy started.\nI mean he had -- some of this was getting the milking equipment there, that is part of the problem.\nMr. Chief Justice on page 14 through 16 of our reply brief we have addressed that very point with several cases, the relevancy of Mission Dairy as prior art or evidence of ordinary skill in the art.\nWell --\nWe're saying \u2013 we're saying that it was effectively publicized at the time he goes to California and files those plans.\nNow that -- but that just Herbert Meyer.\nChester Whitmore's plan was written in a Hoard's Dairyman as early as 1953.\nFrank Susa was building dairy barns as early as 46 and Emile Rody who was --\nNo, that is really not correct because Herbert Meyer was the key to us of locating these other three individuals.\nNo sir, it is my position --\nOn the record of this sir --\nThat's true.\nThat's true.\nWell?\nThe first question seems to me to be the validity of the patent --\nWell, Mr. Justice it is my position that the record is sufficient as it was in the Fifth Circuit before we went back to the third hearing before Judge Wood, I do think that this Court if it feels if there is any doubt as to the validity of this case it should consider this case -- it should consider the evidence that was offered before Judge Wood and the --\nBecause they have found or they did not consider --\nThat is true, thank you sir.",

    "26": "Does the Reading Company have any remedy here for the injury suffered?\nDoes this bond cover tort --\n-- its in the receiver or?\nBut if -- just a moment on that.\nIs it a performance bond for the benefit of third parties?\nWhat's the other remedy?\nYou said they're --\nAgainst who?\nAgainst whom?\nPersonally?\nPersonal liability?\nAnd if he -- and if the trustee has to respond and Mr. Knight has to respond here, he has no recourse over against the estate of the company, does he?\nWell if --\nWell, then that's just to ring around the rose, he had in that, not clear if that's a correct theory because what you're saying now -- the following, as I understand it, there's a fire caused by the negligence of the receiver.\nThe receiver can be sued on his personal capacity.\nThe receiver then has recourse over against the bankrupt estate.\nNow if that is so, then in that effect of this is that the bankrupt estate for whatever it may be, whatever may be in that estate is liable to the persons suffering from tort.\nNow, what you are saying, it's a claim against the estate --\n-- and not just a claim against the receiver?\nNow what you're saying is that it's a -- it is not entitled.\nIt's a claim, which is not entitled to -- Oh, it can't be that either.\nSuppose a receiver had judgments obtained against the receiver while the bankruptcy proceedings is still pending then the receiver has a claim over against the estate, you've tell me for -- to be made whole, is that right?\nNow suppose the bankruptcy is still pending, he has at least a general claim against the estate.\nDoes he have a priority claim as the cost of the administration?\nOr does -- where does he rank?\nDoes this claim rank along with other creditors?\nAnd how does he come in?\nYou don't' believe that the trustee has personal liability even after he's discharged?\nBecause I got the -- presume that the preceding counsel took the opposite view.\nBut then he went further than that and said that there would be personal liability on the part of the receiver and I gather that, perhaps wrong, that his position was that -- to me personal liability on the part of the receiver even if there were no willfulness that it's just straight negligence.\nExcuse me, but let me see if I correctly understand your position.\nYour position is that Chapter XI proceeding is pending, if the litigation has started on a tort claim prior to bankruptcy, the Chapter XI merging into a bankruptcy proceeding, then by virtue of 63 (a), that's provable, right?\nThat's point one.\nPoint 2, if Chapter XI and it goes on to the end, an arrangement among creditors, without any bankruptcy proceeding then hopefully the tort claim will be settled out whether or not a suit has been filed just by an informal arrangements among claimants, is that right?\nIf it is not settled out, this is third possibility, in the Chapter XI proceeding.\nAnd if the Chapter XI proceeding does not merge into a bankruptcy or the next, if the litigation has not begun before bankruptcy, then the claim survives against the company as it immerges from the Chapter XI or straight bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn that event, until your position is and until -- at least until the trustee is discharged, a suit may be brought against the trustee.\nRecovery may -- do you think be had on his bond?\nThat liability of the trustee may be established than that may -- a claim may thereby be asserted against the bankrupt estate?\nHave I summarized that correctly or am I wrong?\nWell, he wouldn't --\nHe's just a claimant.\nIn my case, he had introduced his tort claim, the judgment.\nWell, what about the other theory that's been discussed here this morning, that this is to say that this is a tort committed by the trustee, receiver trustee, that an action may be brought against him and that the recovery and it went to -- his liability is established, there -- recovery can be had and he has a claim over against the estate.\nIs that what you understand of defense just in here?\nWell, there are two things here.\nOne, that is to be personally liable and then a variant of that suggested by counsel for the Government that he could be sued and that a liability would be -- would then be after judgment was obtained against the trustee, a liability will then be the liability of the estate.\nI must confess, I'm a little confused as to --\n-- precise meaning of these two --\nWell, if the tort had at this part, it had occurred three days before the Chapter XI proceeding and no question with that -- it would have been a tort that would not -- there would've been a claim not provable in Chapter XI or subsequent bankruptcy.\nIs that right?\nUnless you have brought suit before the petition was filed.\nAlright, but that was -- that's what statute said, didn't it?\nNow, so that the schemes of statutes are arguable as such you draw a line, you erect a Chinese wall at the date of the filing of the petition insofar as tort claims are concerned?\nNow here, you have a tort that occurred during the period of the administration under Chapter XI and you are saying that the -- that does not -- that tort claim does not survive.\nThat's not a claim against the debtor as the debtor emerges from Chapter XI or from the subsequent bankruptcy proceeding.\nAnd you say that also you have no claim against the trustee personally?\nAnd that unless you have a claim against the assets, against the bankrupt or the debtor under Chapter XI that you have no recourse whatsoever?",
    "27": "Mr. Sidle, will you remind us where the language showed up first, because it is identical language?\nMr. Sidle, in addition to the \"may\" language, it's a double... it's in its discretion.\nIf you just had \"may\", then your argument of the British Rule might be stronger, but\n\"the Court in its discretion may-- \"\nWell, is your point that the district judge did not exercise discretion because the district judge didn't believe that he had discretion with respect to a successful defendant?\nSo... but... am I correct in understanding that at one time the patent fee-shifting statute had identical words, and then Congress added the qualification, \"in exceptional cases\"?\nOf course, the--\n--In any event, the Lanham Act and the Patent Act are the same except for the addition of the words, \"in exceptional cases\".\n--this Court is concerned with disparity among the circuits, and it has the civil rights legislation, and it has the Lanham Act and the Patent Act, and if the question is, as the one on which the Court granted cert, which of these models is the appropriate one for the Copyright Act... now, we have statutes using similar language.\nWhy should this case... why should the Copyright Act be bracketed with the civil rights legislation rather than with the trademark and patent legislation?\nBefore that, it was identical to the Copyright--\n--And was it interpreted, when it was identical to the copyright language, with a tilt toward prevailing plaintiffs?\nThen why did Congress add, in exceptional cases, just to conform the law to what the courts were doing?\nWhat year was that changed?\nThen, when Congress redid the Copyright Act and left it without the qualification, wouldn't the implication be, it wanted to have a standard that would be equal on both sides, but not limited to exceptional cases?\n--But I take it if you were prevailing plaintiff and the same standard applied, you would not get fees--\n--in this very case.\nBut isn't that same assessment made by Professor Brown in his 1960 study, when he said, or if the losing defendant raised real issues of fact or law--\n--If losing defendant raises real issues of fact or law, then he doesn't pay the plaintiff's counsel fees.\nThat's quite a different standard from the one in Christiansburg.\nMr. Robbins, that would be a far more impressive argument if that were the rule with respect to patents and trademark, but you concede it isn't, and what I find so difficult to understand is why the regimes for patent and trademark are not the ones that we should look to.\nThen let's go to the patent law, where you told me that before the change for exceptional cases it was identical and it was interpreted the same way for prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.\nSo why isn't that the closest model for us?\nWhy is that so?\nI'm sorry, I have difficulty following that.\nIt seems in this very case we're talking about the same composer, and a question of whether there was an infringement of something that he himself created.\nThat would be... I can't imagine anything that's more difficult than that, to determine whether you've been careful enough not to copy yourself too much.\nBut is there anything to support your notion that as a general matter it's easier to infringe a patent than a copyright?\nThat really is hemming in the discretion.\nIf you just looked at the statute that says may in its discretion, what you've just said, there really isn't any discretion.\nIt has to be an extreme case, even though... and this statute doesn't use the word, in exceptional cases, as the Patent Act does.\nBut there might be more of a question about whether the item was copyrightable in the first place, because isn't there a rather more stringent test that a patent has to pass than a copyright has to pass?\nSo it's one thing--\n--How about the purpose of the Copyright Act of not allowing the copyright holder to extend that exclusivity too far?\nSome of them written right into the statute, like the fair use defense?\nWouldn't that be vindicating a public policy?\nThe defendant who was saying, this is fair use and this is what Congress says is good for the public?\nThat's true of defendants generally, right?\nMr. Robbins, do you attribute any significance to... the image of the civil rights plaintiff is the individual alone against the Government, against the corporation, but that doesn't translate in the copyright and patent area, where, as in this very case, the plaintiff is a corporation, and the defendant is an individual, so the two don't fit together very neatly, do they?",
    "28": "Mr. Chief Justice, and it please the Court: I would like to make three initial points. First, what this case is about is whether the Petitioner may bring a Fourth Amendment claim for unlawful detention pursuant to legal process. Second, this case is not about whether the decision to prosecute is governed by due process, the Fourth Amendment, or any other amendment. And third, this case is not about whether there's some constitutional tort named malicious prosecution. \u00a0All we ask the Court to do is to affirm your numerous -- numerous suggestions made in Albright that the Fourth Amendment supports this cause of action, and bring the Seventh Circuit in line with all other -- with the Tenth Circuit ruling on this.\nWhat -- what I need what we need to do is determine the -- not the statute of limitations, which is two years, set by State -- State -- by the State, but the accrual period. \u00a0And in Wallace, the Court has said that we -- you normally look to, not the State law, but it's a Federal question, that you normally look in reference to the common law. And in Wallace, they did say that that would be malicious prosecution that does have as an accrual period favorable termination.\nBut our claim, technically, here is it is detention without probable cause, not the search that occurred when he's -- when he was arrested.\nRight. \u00a0And that went through for 48 days after he -- after he became subject to legal process. \u00a0I guess --\nYou haven't proper legal process. \u00a0You're -- you're correct. \u00a0It's been corrupted because --\nCorrect.\nCorrect.\nCorrect. \u00a0That's.\nYes. \u00a0You are, I wish I could take credit for that, but -- (Laughter.)\nRight. \u00a0Right. Wallace talked about malicious prosecution. \u00a0And this is a larger issue of 1983 jurisdiction, which is, you know, what is a proper accrual period for a constitutional -- a constitutional violation. \u00a0We don't -- we're not --\n-- cause. \u00a0Right. don't -- you're not -- you're not straightjacketed into a particular common-law provision. \u00a0You're -- you have the right to fashion one that does justice, and this is the one that does -- does justice.\nYes. \u00a0But that's -- just a label, and that's what -- what the court, at least in Wallace, has used as a label for talking about these type of claims, and in other -- in Gerstein, too. It's just -- it's just a label to, in a sense, distinguish this case from detention without legal process.\nNo. \u00a0We would say Fourth Amendment -- at least based on your cases -- the Fourth -- the Fourth Amendment claim ends at conviction.\nAnd then the due claim or whatever.\nOne reason is that Gerstein -- the Gerstein hearing is a nonadversarial hearing, so it would be a -- a grand jury proceeding. While a -- a conviction, in a sense, presumes that you're -- you're -- you -- you are -- you are held with probable cause, and then you really have a due process claim after that.\nI believe -- I believe.\nNo. \u00a0It's really Fourth -- well, here, it's a Fourth Amendment claim. We're not -- we're not raising --\nIn your release?\nWell, yes --\nRight. \u00a0But you have be -- there has to be a favorable termination in order for you -- it's an element of -- of State court malicious prosecution, so you need to be --\nIt would be a malicious that would be a malicious prosecution claim under State law.\nYou -- you could if you if you ruled that way. \u00a0Generally, this Court has ruled that after conviction, there is -- there is due process, your trial rights have been violated, so that has been a different amendment that you've gone under. \u00a0In this case --\nIt could be a -- it be a Fourth Amendment right. \u00a0You could have more than one amendment cover more than one -- the same set of facts.\nWell, we're claiming a Fourth Amendment right.\nYes, it could be Usually -- or at least reading Justice Kennedy's concurrence, it appeared that the due process provision -- the due process claim dealt with the issue of whether to prosecute, as opposed to this issue, which is the decision to hold somebody, detain somebody, pending a decision to prosecute or a trial. \u00a0So it's the Fourth Amendment that really covers this rather than due process.\nNo. \u00a0No.\nYes. \u00a0And in and in Gerstein, the Court did make recognition that -- that detention could go beyond being released, depending on the conditions of the release. \u00a0So it's not just -- I would say it's not just Justice Ginsburg's concurrence. It was this Court's opinion in Gerstein that that was a possibility.\nI think there's -- some good reasons for that. \u00a0They were expressed in Heck, which applies in this particular case, too. \u00a0You don't want to have parallel -- parallel litigation. \u00a0You don't want to have conflicting decisions between the State and the criminal court, and you don't want to -- you don't want to have a collateral attack. \u00a0That collateral attack works to the detriment of -- of the prosecution and to the defense in the case. I think Justice Kagan's opinion in Kelly illustrates the harm that could happen to the prosecution if you allow someone to collaterally attack -- use a sophisticated attorney to collaterally attack the decision on probable cause while the case -- while the criminal case is pending. \u00a0If it works to the detriment of the prosecution --\nI would be in with that, because --\nI would be in with that.\nI only -- only -- only response to the question. \u00a0So I think the question we've raised is solely the issue of does the Fourth Amendment cover detentions pursuant to legal process?\nWithout -- I'm With -- no, with. \u00a0With legal --\nYes. \u00a0But it's still legal -- it's still a legal process. \u00a0It was corrupted, but it was still started with that.\nYes. \u00a0And the point is the Fourth Amendment. \u00a0If you answer the question on the Fourth Amendment, because the initial question --\nNo. \u00a0I'm saying the can say that this is a Fourth Amendment claim. \u00a0It's --\nThere's no -- yeah. as if -- if they had brought it up in Albright.\nCorrect.\nNo. \u00a0I -- I think decide whether there's a Fourth Amendment claim or a due process without referencing the statute of limitations. That issue is, in a sense, before you. \u00a0You can answer it. We're not talking about -- as I said before, we're not claiming that the decision to prosecute, which might be a due process claim, has been violated. \u00a0All we're talking about is the detention -- the detention subject to legal or corrupt legal process. \u00a0That's the only claim that we're asking for. \u00a0The Court has indicated --\nAll right. \u00a0May I time after just some more questions? I think this is a Fourth Amendment claim that you can -- you can describe as being corrupted by -- you know, a corrupt Gerstein hearing. \u00a0You would claim that it prolonged a detention beginning at -- at legal process the way County of Riverside -- or Rodriguez, where it was extended just for -- the traffic stop was extended just for seven minutes to do a dog search, and this Court found that there was -- it was a seizure, an improper -- improper seizure. This is exactly what happened here. \u00a0The -- the seizure was extended improperly because of the fabrication by the police.\nThank you. Just to answer Justice Kennedy's question about reasonable error on a detention, in that situation, the officer would have the qualified immunity defense that would, assuming it was objectively reasonable, he would -- he would be protected in that situation. With respect to the Seventh Circuit's decision --\nThere's still a Amendment violation, but he would have qualified immunity if it -- if he acted with objective reasonableness. \u00a0Because it's a Fourth -- Fourth Amendment doesn't have any intent. \u00a0You either violate it or not violate it. \u00a0There's either probable cause or not. \u00a0And then you could superimpose qualified immunity. The Seventh Circuit would have said that there is -- there's no Fourth Amendment right, whether or not the Petitioner filed his claim three years, four years, a million years ago, or the day after he was released. \u00a0That's -- that's their position. \u00a0So that's why we're here on the question, whether this is a Fourth Amendment violation. \u00a0We reject the -- the Seventh Circuit's view that it's a due -- due process.\nCorrect. \u00a0But I do note that the Seventh Circuit, with respect to the statute of limitations to the accrual point -- point, uses favorable termination in their due process cases.\nThe -- he would -- at point, if you use Heck as the case that covers this particular issue, he would not -- since he was convicted under Heck, he would not be able to bring the claim if that claim attacks the conviction. If it doesn't attack the conviction, as the Court sort of pointed out in, I think it was in Footnote 7 on suppression hearings or on evidence --\nSo it wouldn't have the.\nThen -- then I would under Heck, the Heck exception, they could bring -- they could bring then suit.\nI think it would accrue that point, at the conviction, as I read Heck. \u00a0Because I think it would be -- it would be -- in this particular case, it would be unfair to the -- to the individual to speculate on whether -- what evidence comes out at the -- at the trial to determine whether or not that really -- that probable cause determination may or may not attack the -- the --\nBecause at the -- at time it -- it has occurred, you -- well, two reasons. You don't know at that time whether or not it does attack the conviction. And second, you don't -- you don't want -- because you don't know whether that evidence heard at the -- at the -- at the -- at the Gerstein hearing may or may not -- some of it may come in; some of it may not. And then the other issue -- the other issue is that you don't want parallel litigation going on, or -- or collateral attack for many of the reasons that -- that was stated in Kaley.",
