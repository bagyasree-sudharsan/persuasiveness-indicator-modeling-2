In fact the FDA has no idea how to define it really and basically any food can slap the word natural on the box. Some use it to mean apart from human beings, but then how can human beings behave in a way that is natural? In short, I basically agree with you that anything man-made is natural but I think that just makes the term useless. ",

When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe. Similarly, when a fundamentalist says that homosexuality is \"unnatural,\" he does not just mean that it is artificial in the sense of being created by society- he means that it is somehow wrong that this is a social artifact of humanity. \n\nI think what you mean to object to is \"natural\" in this sense of the word, which is perfectly reasonable.

But it's not a pro-essential-oil testimony, so maybe you will find it interesting.\n\nI used to go for regular massages with a group of friends. Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for \"relaxation\". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.",

There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.
